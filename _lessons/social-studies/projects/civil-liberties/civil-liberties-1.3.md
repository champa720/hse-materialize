## Extension

**Investigate Court Cases from the 20th and 21st Centuries:** Assign each student a different year or span of years to research a court case decided by the Supreme Court. Tell them to choose one case that they find interesting.  They should use online sources to investigate the court case. Tell them to prepare a one-minute presentation for the class in which they summarize the court case, the decision made by the court, and why that decision was made. Encourage students to use a chart as a visual for their presentation.
