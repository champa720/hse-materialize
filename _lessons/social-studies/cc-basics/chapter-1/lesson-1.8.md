## Before Lesson

Ask students if they know what public policy is. (government actions that affect everyone) Tell students that public policy affects many areas of life for Americans, from health care to driving laws. Explain that students will learn more about public policy in this lesson.

## Background

Invite a volunteer to read the three questions in the introductory paragraph on page 60. (Do you think the speed limit on a certain road should be changed? Do you wish that you paid less taxes? Do you think the government should do more to help people?) Invite students to share their opinions and discuss them as a class. Explain that they are discussing contemporary public policy.

## Guided Practice

- Contemporary Public Policy
  - Types of Public Policy
- Who Makes Contemporary Public Policy?
- Evaluating Public Policy

## Core Skill

**Draw Conclusions:** Demonstrate drawing a conclusion from an online article on public policy. Emphasize how you used several pieces of information to draw your conclusion. Point out that the activity requires students to provide evidence to support their conclusion. Their evidence should consist of at least two pieces of information. Explain that one piece of information may be knowledge that they already had before visiting the website.

**Evaluate Reasoning:** Review with students the three-step process for evaluating the reasoning behind a public policy position. Ensure they understand the steps as well as the reasons for the steps: The two-column table makes it easy to compare the arguments side by side. Evidence is written down so it can be reviewed and evaluated. Facts must be distinguished from opinions to eliminate bias.

## Extension

**Write Headers as Main Idea:** Statements Review the lesson with students. Guide students into rewriting each sect ion header as a declarative sentence that states the main idea of the text that follows the headers.

**Develop a Logical Argument:** As a class, agree on a public policy to debate. Create two teams with two members each. One team should be for the policy and the other should be against it. Other class members should assist the teams by conducting Internet research to organize data that can be cited as evidence for each team's argument. Stage the debate m class: a member of each team should give a three-minute speech relating their position and citing evidence to support their argument. Next, have other team members give one-minute rebuttal speeches. Conclude with a question-and-answer session with the class
