(Possible questions: Why didn't most of the North use slave labor? As the country grew, did new states and territories want to have slavery? How did the Union stay together with such a big difference of opinion?)"

## Before Lesson

On the board, create two concept webs, one for the North and one for the South. Begin filling in the webs using what students remember from previous lessons about issues such as states' rights, the balance of power in Congress, and the development of manufacturing and industry in the North. Tell them to continue their webs as they read about the problem of slavery and the events immediately preceding the Civil War.

## Background

Point out that the Civil War was not only about slavery, but it was also about economic, political, and social divisions between the North and the South. Even though the North's victory preserved the Union, it did not resolve these divisions. Explain that this lesson will examine how these divisions led to war and how the division continued during Reconstruction.

  - Founding the Republican Party

## Core Skill

**Locate Sources:** Tell students that the US Civil War has been a popular topic for many writers, historians, and filmmakers. Demonstrate doing an online search for media on a Civil War topic, such as text of the Emancipation Proclamation. As students work on the activity, encourage them to share the sources they find in their online searches.

**Recognize Persuasive Language:** Have students compare their sentences and analyses with a partner's. Invite volunteers to share their analyses with the class, explaining why they feel Douglass was or was not successful. Tell them to support their opinions with evidence from the text of the speech.

**Recognize Persuasive Language:** Analyze the Martin Luther King, Jr., speech with students and identify persuasive language. Then have students analyze the Nixon speech. Have them share and compare their ideas.

## Extension

**Question Structure:** As students work on their questions for the various sections of the lesson, remind them of how questions are constructed: Most questions invert the order of the subject and verb; often this is done by adding some form of the verb do. (Did you go to the game last night? When does the game start?) The main exception is questions in which who is the subject. (Who is the team's captain? Who scored the winning goal?) Check students' questions to make sure they have structured them correctly.

**Develop a Logical Argument:** Have students modify their persuasive writing to make it into a speech .Tell them to use both logical and emotional arguments to defend their position. Encourage them to practice the speech several times in front of a mirror. Then invite volunteers to share their speeches with the class.
