## Before Lesson

In this lesson, students learn that integers are positive and negative whole numbers. They will compare and order them and find their absolute value. To check for readiness, have students mark 0 and the first few positive whole numbers on a number line. To demonstrate readiness for absolute value, have students practice finding the distance between two numbers on the number line.

## Background

Explain that integers are the set of whole numbers and their opposites. As the class progresses through the chapter, have them research marine organisms. Students should find three organisms that live at different depths. Have students write the depths from least to greatest negative number on a vertical number line.

## Guided Practice

- Understand Integers
- Absolute Value

## Core Skill


**Apply Number Sense:** After reading the section, explain to students that they will learn about absolute value on the next page. Tell them to consider what absolute value means and how it could apply to real-life as they read the next page.

**Represent Real-World Problems:** Give students time to read the sidebar. To help them answer the assignment at the end, ask them if they have ever purchased something and then returned it the following month. Discuss reasons why credit card companies use positive numbers to represent the balance of money loaned.

## Extension

**Interpret a Model:** Show students a thermometer, or an illustration of a thermometer. Ask students to explain how a thermometer works as a model of positive and negative integers. Encourage students to use the words integers, opposites, and absolute value in their discussions. Provide students with more real-world examples if they are having difficulty with these terms.

**Collect and Display:** Have students use print or online resources to find real-world examples of positive and negative numbers, such as the elevation of landforms relative to sea level or the loss and gain of yards during play in a football game. Ask students to create a printed or digital display of the example and explain its relevance to positive and negative numbers.
