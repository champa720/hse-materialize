### Anticipatory Set

The word poet comes from the Greek word poesis, meaning "to make." To create new and exciting language, a poet needs imagination. Poets use carefully chosen words to create images and figures of speech. The language of a poem enables us to understand the poet's vision almost as if we could experience it with our own senses. Just as an artist uses colors to make a painting, so a poet chooses words to convey thoughts and feelings. Images and figurative language make poetry come alive. Poets use Imagery to share their way of seeing the world. Images are what the words of a poem enable you to see. They are the pictures that come into your mind as you read the poet's words. They are your link to the poet's imagination.

  Almost mechanical \\
  Along the crumbling stone wall \\
  Then sits still \\
  And sergeant straight.
