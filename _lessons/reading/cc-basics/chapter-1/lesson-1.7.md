## Before Lesson

Make sure students understand what is meant by media. Explain that a medium is a method of communicating information, such as a newspaper or a website, and that there are many different types of media. Ask students to list in their notebooks as many kinds of media as they can. Ask volunteers to explain which forms of media they prefer for news, for entertainment, and for researching information. Write volunteers' media choices on the board and discuss with the class to reach a consensus on the group's most frequently used forms of media.

## Background

Before students start the lesson, engage them in a discussion of different kinds of media presenting the same material. Show students a front-page story from the newspaper and have them read it. Then go online to one of the national news service websites and play a video story or interview about the same event. Discuss how each medium handled the story. How effective do students think the newspaper and the website coverage are? Did they notice different items of information in one medium or the other? Tell students to write a sentence comparing and contrasting the story coverage by the two media. Ask volunteers to read their sentences to the class.

## Guided Practice

- Texts in Different Media

## Core Skill

**Evaluate Content in Different Media:** After students have listed the main ideas of the online and audio versions of the weather report, pair them with classmates and have them explain to each other the reasons they believe that changes were made in the content of the report from one medium to the other.

**Draw Conclusions:** After students discuss their conclusions with classmates, ask them to write a brief paragraph explaining what they have learned about on-the-job training and whether they would want to engage in such training.

## Extension

**Visualizing Text:** The subtitled video presentation about on-the-job training (see link on page 70) provides a meaningful context for word recognition and reading. The captions allow students to confirm what they have are hearing on the audio track. Ask students to watch the video two or three times in quick succession while concentrating on hearing and seeing the narrator's words simultaneously.

Following their repeat viewings, ask students to discuss in pairs what they learned from the video. Have one member of each pair relate their combined perception to the class.

**Organize a Presentation:** Ask students to apply what they learned about the effectiveness of different media types. Tell students to write a brief informative text and also construct an audio, video, or multimedia version of the same message. Tell them to select their own topic or to use a topic from the lesson, such as a weather advisory or a recipe.

## Lesson Review

**21st Century Skills: Media Literacy:** When students complete their paragraphs comparing and contrasting the video and multimedia presentations they accessed, ask for volunteers to share their experiences and conclusions with the class.
