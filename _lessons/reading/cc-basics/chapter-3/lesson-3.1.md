## Before Lesson

Tell students that forms, instructions, websites, blogs. magazine and newspaper articles, and editorials are types of nonfiction informative text. Tell students that the purpose of these texts may be to inform or to persuade. Ask students for an example of a nonfiction text they have read for information and an example of one that tried to persuade them. (Sample answers: information: textbook or magazine; persuasive: editorial or argumentative essay.) Tell students that they will be learning more about persuasive writing in this lesson.

## Background

Point out to students that they all see ads constantly. To navigate through this maze of information, they need to study ads carefully. Show students two or three ads from a recent print publication. As students read the ads, ask: What does the ad want you to think, buy, or do? Explain that reading ads effectively can help students better decide whether the advertised product or action is something they need or want.

## Guided Practice

- Ads

## Core Skill

**Evaluate Arguments:** Read the questions with students. Show the class an ad for a product, either a good or a service, and have them answer the questions together. Then have partners use the same process to evaluate another ad. After they have finished, discuss as a class how evaluating the arguments in the ads can make students more knowledgeable consumers.

**Analyze Word Choices:** Make a two-column chart on the board. Label one column Facts and the other column Opinions. Read the passage on page 120 with students and discuss the effectiveness of the photograph and the text elements. Ask what students think of the name of the product. Have students list the facts and opinions from the passage as you write their responses on the board. Discuss the author's purpose for writing the ad and whether or not students would call the builder.

## Extension

**Persuasive Language:** Find examples of persuasive language from the lesson, then have students work with a partner to write one sentence that uses persuasive language.

**Critique Ads:** In small groups, have students analyze real-world advertisements.

Answer the following questions:

1. What real information is included in the wording of the product?
2. What claims are backed up by facts?
3. What claims does the ad want you to accept on faith?

Have students create their own advertisement and share with the class. They should be able to justify their use of fact and opinion.
## Lesson Review

**Write to Learn:** Tell students that to write an effective ad, they should use descriptive words. Explain that in writing an ad, they should give a clear overall impression, include specific details, and organize sentences so it is easy to picture what is being described. Have partners check each other's completed ads to make sure they have included at least two facts and two opinions. Tell students to revise as necessary.
