## Before Lesson

Explain that there are various types of nonfiction informative texts, including forms, instructions, websites, blogs, magazine and newspaper articles, and editorials. Explain that there are other types of nonfiction writing that tell about people's lives. Ask students if they have ever read or written a memoir, personal essay, letter, or diary. Ask: If you were writing about your life, what subjects or events would you include? List student responses on the board and connect them to a type of writing that could include these elements.

## Background

Tell students that writers choose different forms of nonfiction prose to communicate their ideas or stories. Depending on what he or she wants to say, one author may choose the memoir form while another may choose the diary form. Show students an online or print version of part of a memoir. As students read it, have them identify information about a real person or people.

## Guided Practice

- Nonfiction Prose

## Core Skill

**Analyze Text Connections:** Read the diary entry on page 156 with students and emphasize words that tell how the author describes feelings (beautiful, affectionately, blood boils, insolent air, clicks his shiny little boots, satiated, gorged, struts, snake, plays, comedy, anger, tragedy). Have them answer the questions about the diary entry and read aloud the sentences that helped them find the text connections. (Sample answers: The author is angry because the police officer is wearing a new coat and hat and looks like he has had enough to eat. The author says the police "are playing a comedy with their own tragedy." The police officer is causing the anger. The details about the sunny day, the officer's new clothes, and how well fed he looks help you understand the author's feelings.)

**Identify Types of Nonfiction:** Make a four-column chart on the board and label the columns Diaries, Letters, Essays, Memoirs. Have students copy the chart in their notebooks. Have students list the features of each type of nonfiction prose on their chart. At the end of the lesson, have them read their lists aloud and add their responses to the chart on the board. Tell students to revise or add to their charts, as necessary.

## Extension

**Words Taken from Another Language:** Tell students that genre and memoir are French words used in English. Use the glossary in the student book to teach the correct pronunciation of genre (ZHAN ruh) and memoir (MEM wah). Have students look through the lesson and other familiar texts and create a list of other foreign words they know that are used in English. Write the list on the board and have students define the words.

**Observations about Nonfiction:** Have students work in small groups to complete a chart with the names of nonfiction texts they have read recently in addition to those in the lesson. Have groups list the title, the genre, and the author's purpose for each. Next, have each group make observations about the types of nonfiction texts they find most informative and which they find the most enjoyable.
