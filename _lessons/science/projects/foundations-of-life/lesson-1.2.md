## Before the Lesson

Each member of a team-whether a sports team, an acting troupe, or a community action committee-plays a specific role within the team and follows a unique set of rules for that role. At the same time, each member contributes to the overall function of the team. Ask students to visualize this concept as they learn about cells.

## Background

Every cell in the body has functions it must perform in order to survive, as well as specialized functions for its cell type. Among these are obtaining energy, synthesizing structural and functional components, and eliminating waste. Eukaryotic cells have specialized structures, called organelles, which aid the cell in accomplishing the required functions. Animal and plant cell shave some of the same organelles that perform the same functions; however,  there are structures unique to each cell type. To check prior knowledge, ask students to identify some of the main differences among plant cells and animal cells.

## Guided Practice

- The Parts of a Cell
- Transport Across the Cell membrane

## Extension

**Create and Label Drawings:** Have students draw and label the plant cell and the animal cell shown on page 136. Then ask students to prepare a three-column table. Have students list plant cell structures in the first column and animal cell structures in the second column. Remind students that many of these structures are found in both plant and animal cells. In the third column, ask students to use their own words to state the function of each structure. Help students with the pronunciation of the names of cell structures such as mitochondria, nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum. As students read the lesson, encourage them to add details to their drawings and their tables.
