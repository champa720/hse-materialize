  title: Evidence-Based Reading
  content: "**Collaborative Reading:** - Read aloud the section titled Reproduction in Flowering Plants. Read the first sentence, and then select a student to read next. The student reads a sentence and selects the next reader. Repeat until every student has had a chance to read aloud. Assist students as needed."

  title: 21st Century Skill
  content: "Ask students to review the diagrams in the lesson. Ask: What purpose does each of these diagrams have? Are they the same purpose? Help students see that different diagrams have different purposes, including describing, explaining, and giving examples. Then discuss how visual tools provide details that are critical to clear communication. Read the sidebar text with students. Invite them to work independently or in pairs to write about a topic of interest. Remind them to include critical details that help readers understand the topic. Also encourage them to provide a diagram or some other visual device to communicate content related to their topics. Encourage students to share their final work."

  title: Writing Practice
  content: "Remind students to think through every part of their journey before attempting to write. Encourage students to use the best possible type of diagram to show their journey, such as a map or a flow chart. Afterward, ask students to compare their visuals with the visuals in the lesson. Explain that the visuals in the lesson provide levels of detail and accuracy sufficient to help readers understand important concepts. Ask: Does your visual have sufficient detail and accuracy to make it useful to someone unfamiliar with your neighborhood? What could you do to make it more useful?"

## Before Lesson

Determine students' readiness for learning by discussing prior knowledge of flowers and flowering plants. As a class, make a list of various kinds of flowering plants along with brief descriptions. Point out that there is great variety in the appearance of flowers, including their shape and color.

## Background

Explain to students that just like humans, flowering plants contain specific reproductive structures for passing on their genetic material and producing offspring. Other (non-reproductive) structures are also important in helping the plant remain healthy and capable of reproducing. Pollination is the process by which plants transfer reproductive materials between one another. Lead a discussion exploring why certain flowers and plants might attract different kinds of pollinators.

- Integrate Text and Visuals
- Photosynthesis
- Reproduction in Flowering Plants

## Core Skill

**Apply Scientific Models:** Read the text with students and work with them to answer each question. Afterward, ask students why models are so useful in science. Then write the term computer model on the board. Explain that a computer model is a program that simulates an event, or in other words, shows how an event happens in the real world. For example, explain that in 2007, researchers at the University of Illinois used a computer model to simulate photosynthesis, a process too elaborate and microscopic to observe in nature. Invite students to discuss the kinds of computer models they have seen or would like to see to help them understand a natural process.

**Integrate Text and Visuals:** Review the illustration on this page with the class. Lead a discussion about how the illustration, along with its labels, helps in understanding the text on the page. Be sure to point out the use of labels in identifying structures.

## Extension

**Demonstrate with a 3-D Model :** To help students understand the parts of a flower, bring a flower to class. Help students identify each part of the flower and create labels for each part.

**Construct an Advertisement:** Have students select a particular flower and market that flower to potential pollinators. Have them develop a brochure, poster, or video that advertises the flower's merits to its potential pollinators.
