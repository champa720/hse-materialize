  title: Evidence-Based Reading
  content: "**Preview the Lesson:** Write the word preview on the board. Underline the base word view, and ask students to provide a synonym, or word with a similar meaning. Then circle the prefix pre-, and explain that when these letters appear before a base word, they mean before. Ask students to explain what people do when they preview a text, such as a lesson in this book. Then organize students into pairs. Give students time to work with their partners to preview the lesson. Tell them that they are going to read titles, subtitles, boldfaced words, and visuals to find clues as to what the text is about. Afterward, give students time to share the clues they found. Explain that previewing a text before reading is an effective comprehension strategy they can apply with any text."

  title: 21st Century Skill
  content: "**Information, Communications, and Technology Literacy:** Have a class discussion to learn about the results of students' research on satellite technology. Discuss with students that while satellites give us the technology to study what is happening to polar ice caps and glaciers, it does not give us the means to change what is happening. Have students do further internet research to determine ways that scientists propose we can slow or stop polar ice melting."

  title: Writing Practice
  content: "Review with students that cause and effect relationships do not begin and end with one event but continue on, with the effect becoming the cause of another effect, and so on. Have students treat the effect from their original paragraph as the cause of the next event and write another paragraph following the same rules as before."

## Before Lesson

Draw a two-column chart titled Resources. Ask students to name resources they use regularly, such as water and gas. Place renewable resources in the left column and nonrenewable resources in the right. Do not tell the students which column is which. After the list is made, ask students to explain the difference between the two columns.

## Background

Discuss with the class recent news concerning pollution, the use of natural resources, and the environment. Encourage students to offer personal knowledge and experience with recycling, pollution, climate change, or other environmental issues. Return to the discussion, as appropriate, as you go through the lesson.

## Guided Practice

- Environmental Problems
  - Limited Natural Resources
  - Pollution
    - Garbage
    - Hazardous Wastes
    - Air Pollution
    - Water Pollution
  - Uses of Land and Water
  - Endangered Species
- Global Climate Change

## Core Skill

**Distinguish Between Facts and Speculation:** Tell students that when researching information about environmental problems, they must be very careful to distinguish between facts and speculation in the materials they find. When doing online research, students should rely mainly on websites that end in ".gov" or ".edu" to ensure they are reviewing research that can be relied on to be factual and objective.

**Cite Textual Evidence:** Have students compare their answers to the ## Core Skill activity on this page. Have students discuss the conservation methods that have helped the American bison and bald eagle recover. Have students work together to learn more about some of the other animals listed in this section.

## Extension

**Practice Accuracy:** Invite students to take turns closing their eyes and pointing to a word on a page. Have them read the word silently and then clap once for each syllable in the word, saying the word aloud at the same time. Help students understand that by recognizing syllables in words, they are better able to read word parts instead of individual letters, which leads to greater fluency.

**Identify Research Questions:** Have students work in pairs or small groups and ask them to select an environmental news story from the television, internet, radio, or a magazine that they can read together. As they read, have them identify and write down questions for further research. Have students compile their lists and select the points of research they will pursue. When their further research is completed, have them create a report that includes their own research.
