## Before Lesson

Determine students' readiness for learning about health and disease by asking them to briefly describe health-related stories that they have recently seen in the media. Ask students what stories have been the most interesting to them and which ones have been most relevant to their life or to the lives of their family members. Tell students that the public must be skeptical when hearing popular health-related news, and remind them that they must use their critical thinking skills before accepting every news story at face value.

## Background

Ask a student volunteer to read the two paragraphs following the - title: Key Concept. Ask students to describe the ways in which the roles played by gasoline (in a car) and food (in the body) are similar. Introduce the term wellness and ask students how many of them have heard this term. Point out that the current emphasis on maintaining wellness places a greater emphasis on one's personal responsibility to choose actions that will maintain one's health, just as a car's owner takes responsibility for maintaining his or her automobile.

## Core Skill

**Evaluate Conclusions:** Have students read aloud the first two paragraphs. Ask students to point out the factors in each paragraph that are known to increase the risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Remind students that clinical evidence supports the conclusions about the dangers of these factors.

**Compare and Contrast Multimedia Sources:** Have students look for a media item aimed at children and ask them to analyze and evaluate its educational effectiveness. Ask them to identify who created the item and describe its purpose. Challenge students to describe how a story written by a company selling health-related products might differ from a story in a newspaper.

## Extension

**Extend Language:** Discuss and define additional common words associated with health and disease with which students might not be familiar. Ask students to identify words from the lesson that are unfamiliar and help them to understand their definitions.

**Collect and Display Nutrition:** Information Invite students to collect and display nutrient labels from a variety of snack-food packages. Ask students to create posters classifying the foods as high or low in food value and to assess the overall nutrient content of each food. When finished, encourage students to share their completed posters with the class.
