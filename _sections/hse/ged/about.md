GED Testing Service is a joint venture between Pearson and the American Council on Education (ACE). GED Testing Service provides opportunities to transform lives, support families, and build stronger communities. We offer any adult who wants it the opportunity to earn a high school equivalency credential, prepare for a better job, support their family, and realize their dream for a better life.

The organization is working internally and alongside partners and stakeholders to bring to life a bold new plan that will expand service to the number of adults who need the GED&reg; test. And to the adults who participate it ensures that high school equivalency is a springboard for careers and college.

Currently weâ€™re creating a new GED&reg; assessment and test delivery system that fundamentally changes adult education. The GED&reg; test is the only high school equivalency program recognized by all 50 U.S. states, District of Columbia, U.S. insular areas, and Canadian provinces and territories. Since 1942 more than 18 million adults have earned their GED&reg; test credential. GED&reg; alums contribute to every sector of the workforce. They are teachers, nurses, mechanics, lawyers, and have even included college presidents, governors, entrepreneurs, congressmen, and a U.S. surgeon general.

Nearly 800,000 GED&reg; tests are taken each year, and in 2010, more than 470,000 individuals were awarded their high school credential through the GED&reg; testing program.

GED Testing Service works with state and local partners to deliver the GED&reg; test. Enter your ZIP code in our test center locator to learn more about testing in your area.
