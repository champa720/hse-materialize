##  TASC Test Assessing Secondary Completion™

These days everything changes including the way students learn and how teachers teach. If you were in high school today, you would be in the middle of one of the greatest changes in education since the invention of the computer. It is all about a new way of looking at education, teaching "deep" instead of "wide." Teaching deep means going into what something really means and being able to understand and analyze it. Teaching wide happens when many facts are covered and memorized so you can answer questions on a test. Going deep is all about learning to think about what you are studying, instead of memorizing or simply guessing the answers.

Teachers and others who create education policies developed this new approach. They believed that students in America were not receiving an education that was competitive with other students around the world. To keep American students competitive globally, representatives from many states came together and developed the new standards. These standards are now changing how teachers teach subjects across the country.

In the states that are using the standards, students must be able to meet the goals in all grades and all subjects. That means from the first grade all the way through high school. Because the standards have changed for anyone graduating high school, the test for high school equivalency needed to change as well.

To meet the new standards for high school equivalency, Data Recognition Corporation | CTB developed TASC test.

TASC test covers five subject areas:

  * [Reading](reading.html)
  * [Writing](writing.html)
  * [Mathematics](mathematics.html)
  * [Science](science.html)
  * [Social Studies](social-studies.html)

Each area is a subtest and they all need to be passed in order to pass TASC test. Passing TASC test means you will need to show a level of knowledge and skill that meets or surpasses approximately 60 percent of graduating high school seniors. That means passing TASC test puts you in the same league as 40 percent of the graduating high school seniors, and that is something to be proud of.

TASC test also measures your readiness for college and the 21st century workforce, in which new skills such as computer literacy, science, and mathematics are more important than ever.

Here are some additional things you need to know about TASC test:

  * Three TASC test assessments are available each year in English and Spanish.
  * There are test accommodations if you have special needs including large print, Braille, and audio.
  * The online platform used by TASC test is the same secure platform used by other programs with which you may be familiar—for example, TABE® Online.
