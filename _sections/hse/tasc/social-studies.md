## About TASC Test Social Studies

During the Social Studies test, examinees will be assigned with answering multiple-choice, constructed-response, and technology enhanced questions on history, economics, geography, civics, and government. The Social Studies test gauges examinees’ understanding of the basic principles in each of those areas. To do well, examinees must be able to read passages, illustrations, graphs, and charts.

## The Social Studies Section

At Data Recognition Corporation | CTB, we have organized the TASC Test Assessing Secondary Completion&trade; Social Studies subtest according to varying levels of emphasis. High emphasis areas are incredibly important for test takers, as they are the focus of the majority of questions on the exam.

Start studying for your high school equivalency by familiarizing yourself with these [high emphasis areas](http://www.tasctest.com/blog.html#ufh-i-46796791-the-top-4-areas-of-social-studies-on-the-tasc-test). Once you’ve mastered these areas, you can move onto the medium and low emphases.

### U.S. History

United States history starts with the colonial era (when the first colonies were founded) to present day. Pay special attention to these periods:

  * 1850-1877: [Civil War](http://www.tasctest.com/blog.html#ufh-i-46796515-the-major-events-of-the-civil-war-tasc-social-studies) and Reconstruction
  * 1914-1945: [World War I, the Great Depression and World War II](http://www.tasctest.com/blog.html#ufh-i-46796425-how-world-war-i-caused-world-war-ii-tasc-social-studies)
  * 1945-1970s: Post-War Era

All three of these periods are characterized by important people and events, which you should be familiar with (President Lincoln and the attacks on Pearl Harbor for, example). These events and people changed the nation, and are still important to our understanding of the U.S. today.

### Civics and Government

Test takers should also be familiar with the rights and duties of U.S. citizens.
There is some overlap with U.S. history here because students should be familiar with the Founding Fathers, the U.S. Constitution, and the important values that are at the center of our nation’s belief system.

You should know [how the U.S. government is organized](http://www.tasctest.com/blog.html#ufh-i-46796305-how-the-federal-government-is-organized-tasc-social-studies) at the local, state, and national levels. The system of checks and balances outlined in the Constitution is important in to how the nation functions. However, checks and balances are unique to democracy — and test takers will need to be familiar with other types of government.

### Economics

Economics is the branch of study that’s concerned with how money is created, how it is used, and how it is shared or transferred to others. There are important connections between the government and the economy. Study terms such as:

  * [Microeconomics](http://www.tasctest.com/blog.html#ufh-i-46796257-a-beginner-s-guide-to-microeconomics-tasc-social-studies)
  * Inflation
  * Unemployment
  * The Federal Reserve System
