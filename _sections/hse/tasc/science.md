## About TASC Test Science

For the Science test, multiple-choice questions are pulled from the fields of Physical Science, Life Science, and Earth and Space Science. Each discipline is subdivided into several Core Ideas, which each contain multiple performance expectations. Each test item assesses one performance expectation. Items may require recalling knowledge, applying knowledge and skills, or reasoning. The number of test items per Core Idea is proportional to the number of performance expectations within the Core Idea. As a result, each Core Idea will have about 2–5 items on a given test.

## The Science Section

At Data Recognition Corporation | CTB, we have organized the TASC Test Assessing Secondary Completion&trade; according to varying levels of emphasis. High emphasis areas are incredibly important for test takers, as they are the focus of the majority of questions on the exam. For the Science subtest, focus on: Life, Earth, and Space sciences.

Start studying for your high school equivalency by familiarizing yourself with these high emphasis areas. Once you’ve mastered these areas, you can move onto the medium emphases, which include [matter](http://www.tasctest.com/blog.html#ufh-i-46796245-matter-and-its-interactions-tasc-science), motion, energy, and waves.

### Life Science
 
[Life Science](http://www.tasctest.com/blog.html#ufh-i-46796728-life-sciences-study-tips-cell-structure) is the study of living organisms, their life processes, and how those organisms relate to each other. Test takers must be familiar with the structures and processes of these organisms from the smallest level, cellular life, to the largest level, ecosystems.

Students should also be able to discuss the importance of biological evolution and heredity. Evolution was first proposed by Charles Darwin in the late 1800s. Since then, it has been essential to the scientific understanding of how cellular life has changed over the years and to how [heredity](http://www.tasctest.com/blog.html#ufh-i-46796488-heredity-tasc-science) functions.

### Earth Science
 
[Earth Science](http://www.tasctest.com/blog.html#ufh-i-46796275-earth-and-human-activity-tasc-test-science) is the study of the physical make-up of the earth and its atmosphere. Focus on Earth’s systems, including:

  * Geology
  * Atmosphere
  * Meteorology
  * Oceanography
 
### Space Science and Astronomy
 
Examine earth’s place in the universe. Consider the hierarchy of space:

  * Earth is a planet. It revolves around the sun, which is actually a star.
  * Planets are a part of a solar system. There are eight planets in our solar system.
  * Solar systems are a part of a galaxy. Our solar system is a part of the galaxy the Milky Way.
  * Galaxies are a part of a universe.
 
Our solar system appears to have been formed from a disk of dust and gas, which was drawn together by gravity. Space science is still being explored and is constantly changing. How does it related to the other areas of science?

Remember to ask yourself: How does it relate to the other areas of science? Drawing connections can help you understand science, and better prepare for the subtest.
