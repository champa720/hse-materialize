Directions: Read the passage below and choose the best answer to each question that follows.

Knowing that there would be ample food, if he could but catch it, Pentaquod pulled his canoe farther inland, hiding it among the oaks and maples which lined the shore, for he knew that he must explore this island quickly. And as he moved among the trees and came to a s meadow, he heard the comforting cry so familiar in his days along the great river: "Bob-white! Bob-white!" Now the call came from his left, then from a clump of grass to his right, and sometimes from a spot almost under his feet, but always it was as clear and distinct as if an uncle who could whistle had been standing at his side.

"Bob-white!" It was the call of the quail, that sly bird with the brown-and-white head. Of all the birds that flew, this was the best eating, and if this island held a multitude, Pentaquod could not only survive on his fish but eat like a chieftain with his quail.

With extreme caution he started inland, noticing everything, aware 1s that his life might depend upon the carefulness of his observation. With every step he found only reassurance and never a sight of danger: nut trees laden with midsummer shells not yet ripe; droppings of rabbits, and the signs that foxes lived here, and the location of bramble berry bushes, and the woody nests of eagles, and the honeysuckle twisting 20 among the lower branches of the cedar trees.
