Directions: Read the passage below and choose the best answer to each question that follows.

The deserted road suddenly gave way to a long, wide boulevard. On either side stood a single row of stately oak trees. The overarching branches formed a protective canopy. From the lower limbs, strands of Spanish moss seemed to wave a gray salute.

Tyrone's heart beat faster as the wagon wheels rolled nearer Brentwood. Before the sun dipped beneath the horizon, he had been able to catch a glimpse of the plantation house with its white pillars and the wrought-iron balcony. By some miracle, it was still standing. Four years of civil war had not changed the beautiful old place.

But where was Julia? It wouldn't be homecoming until, from the balcony railing, her voice rang out, calling his name. He walked faster, heading hopefully toward the sound of home.
