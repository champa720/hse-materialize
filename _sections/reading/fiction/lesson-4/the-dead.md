WHY DID MICHAEL FUREY DIE?

Her hand was warm and moist: it did not respond to his touch, but he continued to caress it just as he had caressed her first letter to him that spring morning.

-It was in the winter, she said, about the beginning of the winter when I was going to leave my grandmother's and come up here to the convent. And he was ill at the time in his lodgings in Galway and wouldn't be let out, and his people in Oughterard were written to. He was in decline, they said, or something like that. I never knew rightly.

She paused for a moment and sighed.

-Poor fellow, she said. He was very fond of me and he was such a gentle boy. We used to go out together, walking, you know, Gabriel, like the way they do in the country. He was going to study singing only for his health. He had a very good voice, poor Michael Furey.

-Well; and then? asked Gabriel.

-And then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to the convent he was much worse and I wouldn't be let see him, so I wrote a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the summer and hoping he would be better then.

She paused for a moment to get her voice under control and then went on:

-Then the night before I left I was in my grandmother's house in Nun's Island, packing up, and heard gravel thrown up against the window. The window was so wet I couldn't see so I ran downstairs as I was and there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden, shivering.

-And did you not tell him to go back? asked Gabriel.

-I implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his death in the rain. But he said he did not want to live. I. can see his eyes as well as well! He was standing at the end of the wall where there was a tree.

-And did he go home? asked Gabriel.

-Yes, he went home. And when I was only a week in the convent he died and he was buried at Oughterard where his people came from. O, the day that I heard that, that he was dead!

She stopped, choking with sobs, and, overcome by emotion, flung herself face downward on the bed, sobbing in the quilt. Gabriel held her hand for a moment longer, Irresolutely, and then, shy of intruding on her grief, let it fall gently and walked to the window.
