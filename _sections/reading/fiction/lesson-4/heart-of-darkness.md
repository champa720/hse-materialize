WHAT WERE KURTZ'S LAST WORDS?

She said suddenly very low, "He died as he lived."

"His end," said I, with dull anger stirring in me, "was in every way worthy of his life."

"And I was not with him," she murmured. My anger subsided before a feeling of infinite pity.

"Everything that could be done-" I mumbled.

"Ah, but I believed in him more than any one on earth-more than his own mother, more than-himself. He needed me! Me! I would have treasured every sigh, every word, every sign, every glance."

"I felt like a chill grip on my chest. "Don't," I said, in a muffled voice.

"Forgive me. I-I have mourned so long in silence-in silence... You were with him-to the last? I think of his loneliness. Nobody near to understand him as I would have understood. Perhaps no one to hear... "

"To the very end," I said, shakily. "I heard his very last words... " I stopped in fright. "Repeat them," she murmured in a heart-broken tone. "I want-I want-something- to-to-live with."

"I was on the point of crying at her, "Don't you hear them?" The dusk was repeating them in a persistent whisper all around us, in a whisper that seemed to swell menacingly like the first whisper of a rising wind. "The horror! The horror!"

"His last word-to live with," she insisted. "Don't you understand I loved him-I loved him-I loved him!" I pulled myself together and spoke slowly.

"The last word he pronounced was your name."

"I heard a light sigh and then my heart stood still, stopped dead short by an exulting and terrible cry, by the cry of inconceivable triumph and of unspeakable pain. "I knew it-I was sure!"... She knew. She was sure. I heard her weeping; she had hidden her face in her hands. It seemed to me that the house would collapse before I could escape, that the heavens would fall upon my head. But nothing happened. The heavens do not fall for such a trifle. Would they have fallen, I wonder, if I had rendered Kurtz that justice which was his due? Hadn't he said he wanted only justice? But I couldn't. I could not tell her. It would have been too dark-too dark altogether."
