Directions: Read the passage below, which is from a story by Charles
Dickens. One of the characters is Estella. The other character is Pip. He is
the narrator in the passage, which means he is telling the story from his
point of view. As you read, try to imagine what both characters are like.

The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease,
and after we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out
again into the brewery yard [a place where they make beer). I showed
her to a nicety where I had seen her walking on the casks, that first
old day, and she said with a cold and careless look in that direction,
"Did I?" I reminded her where she had come out of the house, and
given me my meat and drink, and she said, "I don't remember." "Not
remember that you made me cry?" said I. "No," said she, and shook
her head and looked about her. I verily [truly] believe that her not
remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry again,
inwardly-and that is the sharpest crying of all.

"You must know," said Estella, condescending [acting superior)
to me as a brilliant and beautiful woman might, "that I have no
heart-if that has anything to do with my memory."

I got through some jargon [language] to the effect that I took
the liberty of doubting that. That I knew better. That there could
be no such beauty without it.

"Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no
doubt," said Estella, "and, of course, if it ceased to beat I should
cease to be. But you know what I mean. I have no softness there,
no-sympathy-sentiment-nonsense."
