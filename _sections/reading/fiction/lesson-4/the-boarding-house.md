Outside Narrator's Comments

One way of learning about a character is from an outside narrator's point of view. The narrator may describe how a character looks, give you background information, summarize moments from the character's past, or tell you what a character is thinking.

What does the outside narrator tell you about the Mooneys? Read the passage and answer the questions that follow.

Mrs. Mooney was a butcher's daughter. She was a woman who was quite able to keep things to herself: a determined woman. She had married her father's foreman and opened a butcher's shop near Spring Gardens. But as soon as his father-in-law was dead Mr. Mooney began to go to the devil. He drank, plundered the till, ran headlong into debt. It was no use making him take the pledge: he was sure to break out again a few days after. By fighting his wife in the presence of customers and by buying bad meat he ruined his business. One night he went for his wife with the cleaver and she had to sleep in a neighbor's house.

After that they lived apart. She went to the priest and got a separation from him with care of the children.
