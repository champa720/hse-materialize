-- for my Father who lived without ceremony

It's hard you know without the buffalo, \\
the shaman [^1], the arrow \\
but my father went out each day to hunt \\
as though he had them. \\
He worked in the stockyards. \\
All his life he brought us meat. \\
No one marked his first kill, \\
no one sang his buffalo song. \\
Without a vision he had migrated to the city \\
and went to work in the packing house. \\
When he brought home his horns and hides \\
my mother said \\
get rid of them. \\
I remember the animal tracks of his car \\
out the drive in snow and mud, \\
the aerial on his old car waving \\
like a bow string. \\
I remember the silence of his lost power, \\
the red buffalo painted on his chest. \\
Oh, I couldn't see it \\
but it was there, and in the night heard \\
his buffalo grunts like a snore.
