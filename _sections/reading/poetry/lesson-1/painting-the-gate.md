I painted the mailbox. That was fun. \\
I painted it postal blue. \\
Then I painted the gate. \\
I painted a spider that got on the gate. \\
I painted his mate. \\
I painted the ivy around the gate. \\
Some stones I painted blue, \\
and part of the cat as he rubbed by. \\
I painted my hair. I painted my shoe. \\
I painted the slats, both front and back, \\
all their beveled edges, too. \\
I painted the numbers on the gate - \\
I shouldn't have, but it was too late. \\
I painted the posts, each side and top. \\
I painted the hinges, the handle, the lock, \\
several ants and a moth asleep in a crack. \\
At last I was through. \\
I'd painted the gate \\
shut, me out, with both hands dark blue, \\
as well as my nose, which, \\
early on, because of a sudden itch, \\
got painted. But wait! \\
I had painted the gate.
