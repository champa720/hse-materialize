Once near San Ysidro \\
on the way to Colorado, \\
I stopped and looked.

The sound of a meadowlark \\
through smell of fresh cut alfalfa.

Raho would say, \\
"Look, Dad." A hawk

sweeping \\
its wings

clear through \\
the blue \\
of whole and pure \\
the wind \\
the sky.

It is writhing \\
overhead. \\
Hear. The Bringer. \\
The Thunderer.

Sunlight falls \\
through cloud curtains, \\
a straight bright sl1aft.

It falls, \\
it falls, \\
down \\
to earth, \\
a green plant.

Today, the Katzina [^1] come. \\
The dancing prayers.

Many times, the Katzina. \\
The dancing prayers. \\
It shall not end, \\
son, it will not end, \\
this love. \\
Again and again, \\
the earth is new again. \\
They come, listen, listen. \\
Hold on to your mother's hand. \\
They come

O great joy, they come. \\
The plants with bells. \\
The stones with voices. \\
Listen, son, hold my hand.
