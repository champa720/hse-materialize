The whiskey on your breath \\
Could make a small boy dizzy; \\
But I hung on like death: \\
Such waltzing was not easy.

We romped until the pans \\
Slid from the kitchen Shelf; \\
My mother's countenance \\
Could not unfrown itself.

The hand that held my wrist \\
Was battered on one knuckle; \\
At every step you missed \\
My right ear scraped a buckle.

You beat time on my head \\
With a palm caked hard by dirt, \\
Then waltzed me off to bed \\
Still clinging to your shirt.
