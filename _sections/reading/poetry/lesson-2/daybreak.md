In this moment when the light starts up \\
In the east and rubs \\
The horizon until it catches fire,

We enter the fields to hoe, \\
Row after row, among the small flags of onion, \\
Waving off the dragonflies \\
That ladder the air.

And tears the onions raise \\
Do not begin in your eyes but in ours, \\
In the salt blown \\
From one blister into another;

They begin in knowing \\
You will never waken to bear \\
The hour timed to a heart beat, \\
The wind pressing us closer to the ground.

When the season ends, \\
And the onions are unplugged from their sleep, \\
We won’t forget what you failed to see, \\
And nothing will heal \\
Under the rain’s broken fingers.
