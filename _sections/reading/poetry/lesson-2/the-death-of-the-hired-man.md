Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table \\
Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step, \\
She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage \\
To meet him in the doorway with the news \\
And put him on his guard. "Silas is back."\\
She pushed him outward with her through the door \\
And shut it after her. "Be kind," she said. \\
She took the market things from Warren’s arms \\
And set them on the porch, then drew him down \\
To sit beside her on the wooden steps.

"When was I ever anything but kind to him? \\
But I’ll not have the fellow back," he said. \\
"I told him so last haying, didn’t I? \\
If he left then, I said, that ended it. \\
What good is he? Who else will harbor him \\
At his age for the little he can do? \\
What help he is there’s no depending on. \\
Off he goes always when I need him most..."
