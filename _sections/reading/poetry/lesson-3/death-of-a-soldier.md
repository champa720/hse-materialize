Life contracts and death is expected, \\
As in a season of autumn. \\
The soldier falls.

He does not become a three-days' personage, \\
Imposing his separation, \\
Calling for pomp.

Death is absolute and without memorial, \\
As in a season of autumn, \\
When the wind stops.

When the wind stops and, over the heavens, \\
The clouds go, nevertheless, \\
In their direction.
