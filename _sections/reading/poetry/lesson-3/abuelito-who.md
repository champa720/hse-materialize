Abuelito [^1] who throws coins like rain

and asks who loves him

who is dough and feathers

who is a watch and glass of water

whose hair is made of fur

is too sad to come downstairs today

who tells me in Spanish you are my diamond

who tells me in English you are my sky

whose little eyes are string

can't come out to play

sleeps in his little room all night and day

who used to laugh like the letter k

is sick

is a doorknob tied to a sour stick

is tired shut the door

doesn't live here anymore

is hiding underneath the bed

who talks to me inside my head

is blankets and spoons and big brown shoes

who snores up and down up and down up

and down again

is the rain on the roof that falls like coins

asking who loves him

who loves him who?
