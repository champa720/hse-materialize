I lay my hand \\
Upon \\
The coldness of the smooth \\
White stone, \\
My fingers touch the words, \\
I read again: \\
My father's name, \\
Date of birth, \\
Date of death, \\
Veteran of \\
World War I.

"This is your \\
Grandfather's grave," \\
I tell my children, \\
Wishing I coudl tell them, \\
That they would understand, \\
That the man \\
Who was my father, \\
Was of that first generation, \\
Born on old land \\
Newly made reservation, \\
That at twelve, \\
He went to mission School, \\
To learn to wear shoes, \\
To eat with knife and fork, \\
To pray to their Catholic God, \\
To painfully \\
Learn English words, \\
English meanings, \\
White ways of thinking, \\
English words, \\
To speak, \\
To think, \\
To write, \\
English words, \\
When we, \\
My children \\
And I \\
know no others.
