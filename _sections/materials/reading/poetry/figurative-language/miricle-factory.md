Papa's got a job in a miracle-factory \\
downtown someplace, one of those streets \\
west of the avenue, in an old \\
building taller than God. There's a marble lobby, two \\
elevators behind brass gates, a newsstand, \\
and a draft whenever anyone pushes through \\
the glass revolving doors. Upstairs \\
after the corridor, damp, windy cold \\
RING BELL COME IN the loft \\
looks at an air-shaft. Soot settles softly, like snow.\\
I went there once with Papa. Standing soldierly \\
put out my hand to the boss, said, How d'you do. \\
I didn't like it much. The boss said, Boy, \\
when you grow up I want you to remember \\
making miracles is just like any other line, \\
profit and loss, \\
also supply and demand. You got to sell \\
the product, make them believe \\
in it! He shook my hand. \\
Papa said later, He's the boss, without \\
the boss, no factory. Remember that.
