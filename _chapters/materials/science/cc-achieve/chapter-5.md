Pushing a car that is stuck or is broken down may look like hard work. But, in the physical world, no work occurs unless the car moves. Work occurs when a force is applied to move an object over a distance. Understanding the physics behind motion, force, and work can help you to better understand how people and machines do work.

### Goal Setting

You use simple machines at home and at work every day. A knife, a screwdriver, and a pair of scissors are all examples of simple machines. Even the system set up to easily lift a garage door is a simple machine. Most things that help to make a task easier can be thought of as simple machines. Think of a task that you often do at home or at work that is difficult to perform and think of ways you can use a simple machine to make this task easier. Write down your ideas. After you have read this chapter, draw a sketch of a simple machine that might help with your task and explain how it will make the task easier.
