Why is it important to understand human biology? The more we learn about how our bodies work, the more successful we can be at maintaining good health.

To set goals for learning about human biology, make a chart with a row for each of the major body systems covered in this chapter: Skeletal, Muscular, Digestive, Respiratory, Excretory, Circulatory, Nervous, Endocrine, and Reproductive. For each system listed, write a question you want answered to learn more about that system. As you read, look for an answer to each question and write it in the second column for each topic.
