excerpt: "Heredity explains the genetic code and teaches you about inherited traits."

Smell the scent of a flower. Watch a pet at play. Listen to actors in a movie. The things you smell, see, and hear are observable traits. Those traits were inherited from the parents of the plants, pets, and people you observed.

The traits you observe in an organism are the organism's phenotype. The code, or instructions that result in that phenotype, are called the organism's genotype.

A genotype also includes information that is not expressed. It is the complete set of genetic information encoded in genes that reside on chromosomes inside the nucleus of each cell. You can use two parents' genotypes to determine the possible genotypes among their offspring.

In this chapter you will learn about:

### Goal Setting

What are some things about genetics that you find most interesting? What would you like to know about genetics? A KWL chart is a graphic organizer that you can use to identify what you know (K), want to know (W), and have learned (L). List what you already know about genetics in the KWL chart. Then list what you want to know. As you read and discover answers to your questions, return to the chart to record what you have learned. Return to the KWL chart as often as you like throughout your reading.
