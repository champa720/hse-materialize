Mix flour, eggs butter and sugar in a bowl. Would you eat this mixture of food? Probably not! But, if you mix all of these ingredients together and then bake the mixture in the oven you would have a delicious cake! This is an example of chemistry taking place in your kitchen. Chemistry is simply the study of matter and how it can change forms. Changes in matter are illustrated by following a simple recipe, or by studying complex reactions that take place in a laboratory.

### Goal Setting

Choose a relatively simple recipe that involves combining several ingredients and also requires cooking on the stove or in the oven. Write each step of the recipe in a table like the one shown at right. Next, predict whether a chemical or physical change takes place, if a chemical reaction occurs, or a solution is forn1ed at each step. You can check more than one. After you read this chapter, come back to this chart and change your answers if necessary.

| Recipe Step | Physical Change | Chemical Change | Chemical Reaction | Solution Formed |
