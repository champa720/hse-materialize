[Arithmetic properties](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-arith-prop)\\
This tutorial will help us make sure we can go deep on arithmetic. We'll explore various ways to represent whole numbers, place value, order of operations, rounding and various other properties of arithmetic.

[Factors and multiples](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/pre-algebra/factors-multiples)\\
Understanding and finding factors and multiples. After these videos, you'll be ready for fractions.

[Reading and interpreting data](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-math-reasoning)\\
This topic is less about statistics and more about interpreting data--whether it is presented as a table, pictograph, bar graph or line graph. Good for someone new to these ideas. For a student in high school or college looking to learn statistics, it might make sense to skip (although it might not hurt either).

[Measurement](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-measurement)\\
From length to area to volume to time, thinking about how we measure things.

[Fractions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-fractions)\\
Understanding fractions conceptually, using operations with fractions, and converting fractions.

[Decimals](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-decimals)\\
Understanding decimals conceptually, using operations with decimals, rounding and estimating with decimals, and converting decimals.

[Negative numbers and coordinate plane](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-negative-numbers)\\
Extending our understanding of numbers below 0. Thinking about "absolute" distance from 0. We will also look at all 4 quadrants on the coordinate plane.

[Ratios, proportions, units, and rates](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-ratios-rates)\\
Learn all about proportional relationships. How are they connected to ratios and rates? What do their graphs look like? What types of word problems can we solve with proportions?

[Equations, expressions, and inequalities](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-equations-expressions)\\
In this topic, we will look at 1- and 2-step equations, as well as expressions and inequalities.

[Exponents, radicals, and scientific notation](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-exponents-radicals)\\
Understanding and solving exponents, radicals, and scientific notation without algebra.
