[Introduction to algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/introduction-to-algebra)\\
This topic is an overview of the fundamental ideas and tools of algebra.

[One-variable linear equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/one-variable-linear-equations)\\
Learn how to solve linear equations that contain a single variable. For example, solve \\( 2(x+3)=\frac{4x-1}{2+7} \\).

[One-variable linear inequalities](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/one-variable-linear-inequalities)\\
Learn how to solve linear inequalities with a single variable. For example, solve \\( -3(x+1)>2x-7 \\). Learn how to solve compound inequalities. For example, solve \\( 2x+1>3 \\) AND \\( -x-5 < 4 \\).

[Units of measurement in modeling](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/units-in-modeling)\\
Modeling is an amazing world, full of challenges. In this topic, we will start to think about some general modeling concerns, before we dive into modeling situations with different kinds of functions and equations throughout the Algebra curriculum.

[Two-variable linear equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/two-var-linear-equations)\\
Learn about linear equations that contain two variables, and how these can be represented by graphical lines and tables of values.

[Functions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/algebra-functions)\\
Functions are mathematical entities that assign unique outputs to given inputs. Sounds simple? Think again! In this topic you will evaluate, graph, analyze, and create various types of functions.

[Linear equations and functions word problems](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/linear-word-problems)\\
Solve various word problems that involve real world relationships that can be represented by linear equations or functions.

[Sequences](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/sequences)\\
Learn about the various ways in which we can define sequences; Use and construct arithmetic and geometric sequences.

[Systems of linear equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/systems-of-linear-equations)\\
Learn how to interpret solutions to systems of linear equations and solve them.

[Two-variable linear inequalities](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/two-variable-linear-inequalities)\\
In this topic, we study inequalities like \\( x+2y>5 \\) and graph them. This helps us see their solutions. We also explore systems of inequalities (multiple inequalities at the same time) and use them to describe real-world situations.

[Absolute value equations, functions, and inequalities](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/absolute-value-equations-functions)\\
Learn how to solve absolute value equations and how to graph absolute value functions.

[Expressions with rational exponents and radicals](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/rational-exponents-and-radicals)\\
Learn about expressions with rational exponents like \\( x^\frac{2}{3} \\), about radical expressions like \\( \sqrt{2t^5} \\), and about the relationship between these two forms of representation. Learn how to evaluate and simplify such expression.

[Introduction to exponential functions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/introduction-to-exponential-functions)\\
Learn how to construct, analyze, graph, and interpret basic exponential functions of the form \\( f(x)=a \times r^x \\).

[Introduction to polynomials](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/introduction-to-polynomial-expressions)\\
Learn how to add, subtract, and multiply polynomial expressions. For example, write \\( (2x+3)(x-1) \\) as \\( 2x^2+x-3 \\).

[Polynomial factorization](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/polynomial-factorization)\\
Learn how to write polynomial expressions as the product of linear factors. For example, write \\( x^2+3x+2 \\) as \\( (x+1)(x+2) \\).

[Quadratic equations and functions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/quadratics)\\
Learn how to solve quadratic equations, and how to analyze and graph quadratic functions.

[Rational and irrational numbers](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/rational-and-irrational-numbers)\\
Learn about irrational numbers and how to identify them.

[Seeing structure in expressions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra/seeing-structure-in-expressions)\\
Learn how to use algebra in order to solve problems that involve variables whose values are unknown.
