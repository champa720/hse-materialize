*Common Core Basics: Building Essential Test Readiness Skills, Mathematics* will help you learn or strengthen the skills you need when you take any Common Core State Standards-aligned mathematics test. Regardless of your background, you can use this book to learn and practice the mathematical and problem-solving skills that are most important.

Before beginning the lessons in this book, take the **Pretest**. This test will help you identify which skill areas you need to concentrate on most. Use the chart at the end of the Pretest to pinpoint the types of questions you have answered incorrectly and to determine which skills you need to work on. You may decide to concentrate on specific areas of study or to work through the entire book. It is highly recommended that you work through the whole book to build a strong foundation in the core areas in which you will be tested.

*Common Core Basics: Building Essential Test Readiness Skills, Mathematics* is divided into twelve chapters:

 * [Chapter 1: Whole Numbers](chapter-1) introduces place value, ordering and comparing numbers, operations on numbers, factoring, rounding, estimation, and solving real-world problems with whole numbers.
 * [Chapter 2: Decimals](chapter-2) teaches decimal place value, operations with decimals, and solving real-world problems with decimals.
 * [Chapter 3: Fractions](chapter-3) introduces operations with fractions and mixed numbers.
 * [Chapter 4: Integers](chapter-4) explains integer concepts, including absolute value, integer operations, and the coordinate grid.
 * [Chapter 5: Expressions and Equations](chapter-5) teaches writing and evaluating expressions, solving one- and two-step equations and inequalities, and identifying patterns.
 * [Chapter 6: Linear Equations and Functions](chapter-6) introduces linear equations, graphing linear equations, functions, and scatter plots.
 * [Chapter 7: Ratios, Proportions, and Percents](chapter-7) introduces ratios and rates, solving proportions, and solving percent problems.
 * [Chapter 8: Exponents and Roots](chapter-8) teaches how to evaluate expressions with exponents, roots, and scientific notation.
 * [Chapter 9: Data](chapter-9) introduces the measures of central tendency and range, graphs and line plots, and misleading graphs.
 * [Chapter 10: Probability](chapter-10) explains counting methods and introduces probability and compound events.
 * [Chapter 11: Measurement](chapter-11) teaches using customary units, metric units, and converting among units.
 * [Chapter 12: Geometry](chapter-12) explores various geometric figures and solids, scale drawings and measurement, the Pythagorean theorem, and finding perimeter, circumference, area, and the volume of cones and spheres.
