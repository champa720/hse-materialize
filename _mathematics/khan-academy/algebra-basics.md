[Foundations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra-basics/core-algebra-foundations)\\
This topic isn't algebra, but it is a survey of all of the most important pre-algebra skills you need to really digest algebra. These skills also tend to be pretty important in life in general!

[Algebraic expressions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra-basics/core-algebra-expressions)\\
The core idea in algebra is using letters to represent relationships between numbers without specifying what those numbers are!

[Linear equations and inequalities](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra-basics/core-algebra-linear-equations-inequalities)\\
We will now equate two algebraic expressions and think about how it might constrain what value the variables can take on. The algebraic manipulation you learn here really is the heart of algebra.

[Graphing lines and slope](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra-basics/core-algebra-graphing-lines-slope)\\
Use the power of algebra to understand and interpret points and lines (something we typically do in geometry). This will include slope and the equation of a line.

[Systems of equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra-basics/core-algebra-systems)\\
Solving a system of equations or inequalities in two variables by elimination, substitution, and graphing.

[Expressions with exponents](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra-basics/core-algebra-exponent-expressions)\\
Let's build our toolkit that allow us to manipulate exponents algebraically.

[Quadratics and polynomials](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra-basics/quadratics-polynomials-topic)\\
We'll now progress beyond the world of purely linear expressions and equations and enter the world of quadratics (and more generally polynomials). Learn to factor expression that have powers of 2 in them and solve quadratic equations. We'll also learn to manipulate more general polynomial expressions.

[Equations and geometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/algebra-basics/core-algebra-geometry)\\
See how algebra can be useful when solving geometrical problems.
