## Mathematics

  * Time: 90 minutes
  * Format: 50 multiple-choice questions

The Mathematics subtest measures mathematical knowledge and competencies. You are asked to solve quantitative problems using fundamental concepts and reasoning skills. The questions present practical problems that require numerical operations, measurement, estimation, data interpretation and logical thinking. Problems are based on realistic situations and may test abstract concepts such as algebraic patterns, precision in measurement and probability. You may use a calculator for the entire subject test, if you choose to do so.

### Knowledge and Skills Tested

Application of concepts, analysis, synthesis and evaluation involving:

  * Number Operations
  * Measurement
  * Geometry
  * Data Analysis/Statistics
  * Algebra

### Test Features

Stimulus-based materials and discrete items

### Evidence of Proficiency

Test takers demonstrate understanding of mathematical concepts and procedures, make inferences or predictions based on data or information, interpret data from a variety of sources, reason quantitatively and evaluate reasonableness of solutions.
