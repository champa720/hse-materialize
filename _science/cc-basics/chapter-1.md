We certainly hear a lot of advice about how to keep our bodies working well! 

The human body is a complex and unique set of structures and systems. Although humans are the most advanced of organisms, the study of human biology sheds light on the similarities among all life forms.

In this chapter you will learn about:

**[Lesson 1.1: Skeletal and Muscular Systems](lesson-1.1)**\\
How do your bones and muscles work together to help support your body and allow you to move? Find out about the bones, joints, and muscles in the human body.

**[Lesson 1.2: Digestive, Respiratory, Excretory, and Circulatory Systems](lesson-1.2)**\\
The human body is a dynamic system continuously processing nutrients, wastes, and gases. This lesson identifies the organs and processes involved in digestion, respiration, excretion, and circulation.

**[Lesson 1.3: Nervous, Endocrine, and Reproductive Systems](lesson-1.3)**\\
Your body reacts to many different stimuli on a daily basis. You will learn about the body systems responsible for communication and reproduction in this lesson.

**[Lesson 1.4: Health and Disease](lesson-1.4)**\\
Good health is a top priority for everyone. Learn about common diseases, nutrients needed by the body, and how certain drugs can help maintain good health.

**Goal Setting**\\
Why is it important to understand human biology? The more we learn about how our bodies work, the more successful we can be at maintaining good health.

To set goals for learning about human biology, make a chart with a row for each of the major body systems covered in this chapter: Skeletal, Muscular, Digestive, Respiratory, Excretory, Circulatory, Nervous, Endocrine, and Reproductive. For each system listed, write a question you want answered to learn more about that system. As you read, look for an answer to each question and write it in the second column for each topic.
