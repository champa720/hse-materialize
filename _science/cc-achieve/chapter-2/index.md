title: Ecosystems
---

In every environment you will find many organisms that depend on each other and their surroundings. Diversity in populations is a key element to maintaining a healthy environment. However, when you study an ecosystem, you will notice that some populations are much larger than others even though food, water, and energy sources seem plentiful. You might also notice that changes or disruptions in an ecosystem can change the sizes and types of populations either very quickly or over time. 

## Lesson 2.1 Living Things and Their Environment

Every living thing on Earth interacts with both living and nonliving elements that surround it. Learn how organisms adapt to the climate in their environment in order to increase their chances of survival.

## Lesson 2.2 Movement of Energy and Matter

Energy passes through an ecosystem in a complex network of organisms called a food web. Learn how energy and matter flow through an ecosystem, and how living and nonliving elements are affected by changes to the ecosystem.

## Lesson 2.3 Interactions Among Populations

Many factors influence the size of a population, including the interaction between organisms and the amount of resources in the ecosystem. Learn about the different ways in which organisms can interact with each other and how these interactions can affect the size of a population.

## Lesson 2.4 Disruptions to Ecosystems

Disruptions in an ecosystem can be caused by human activity and by environmental disturbances including flood, fire, and the introduction of a new species. Sometimes these disruptions are catastrophic and upset the balance of an ecosystem. In this lesson, learn about both natural and unnatural causes of ecological disruption.

## Goal Setting

It may be difficult to determine what type of ecosystem you live in, especially if you live in a city or a suburb. But, before the land was developed for human use, it was most likely a balanced ecosystem. Find out about the region you live in, and compare the species that once lived there to those that live there today, Use the information in this chapter to help you identify and describe any changes that might have occurred to the ecosystem.
