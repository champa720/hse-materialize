title: Structure and Function of Life
toc: true
---
Every living organism on Earth is composed of one or more cells. Cells contain smaller parts called organelles that must work together in order for the cell to live and reproduce. Simple cells are found in organisms such as bacteria, and more complex cells are found in plants and animals. The cells of animals and plants contain similar cell parts; however, plants cells have additional parts that make them unique. Both plant and animal cells take in and convert energy from their environment to support cellular function.

**[Lesson 3.1: Cells: Basic Units of Life](lesson-3.1)**\\
Once the microscope was invented, scientists were able to see that each living organism was made up of very tiny units called cells. Learn how cells are grouped into several levels, including tissues, organs and body systems in multi-cellular organisms.

**[Lesson 3.2: Cell Structure and Function](lesson-3.2)**\\
Each cell is composed of smaller units called organelles that carry out a specific function in the cell. Learn about the two basic types of cells, and how they are similar and different in their structure and function.

**[Lesson 3.3: Plant Structure and Function](lesson-3.3)**\\
Plants have many different parts that function to ensure their survival and reproduction. Learn how plants can be grouped into different categories according to their structure and that each type of plant can better understood by examining the various parts that make up the whole plant.

**[Lesson 3.4: Energy and Cells](lesson-3.4)**\\
Both plant and animal cells need energy in order to function properly. Learn how plant and animal cells convert the energy molecules into sugar that is used in chemical reactions that produce energy-storing molecules called ATP. ATP is the energy source for all cellular functions.

**[Lesson 3.5: Mitosis and Meiosis](lesson-3.5)**\\
In order for an organism to grow or maintain proper health, new cells must be continuously produced. Learn about the reproduction of cells through the processes of mitosis and meiosis.

**Goal Setting**\\
Choose one type of plant and one type of animal that interests you. Write down the name and a description of the physical characteristics that describe each organism. You can also include a drawing of each organism. Use the information in this chapter to describe how they are similar and different when you look at them on a cellular level.
