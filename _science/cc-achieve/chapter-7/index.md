title: Matter
---

Mix flour, eggs butter and sugar in a bowl. Would you eat this mixture of food? Probably not! But, if you mix all of these ingredients together and then bake the mixture in the oven you would have a delicious cake! This is an example of chemistry taking place in your kitchen. Chemistry is simply the study of matter and how it can change forms. Changes in matter are illustrated by following a simple recipe, or by studying complex reactions that take place in a laboratory. 

## [Lesson 7.1: The Structure of Matter](lesson-7.1)

Matter is made up of very tiny particles called atoms. An element is a pure chemical substance consisting of one type of atom. In this lesson you will learn about atoms and elements, and how elements are organized into the Periodic Table of Elements.

## [Lesson 7.2: Physical and Chemical Properties of Matter](lesson-7.2)

Matter can be described by texture, color, and hardness. Matter also has physical properties that can be measured such as mass, volume or density. Learn how matter can be described by its chemical properties, such as how it reacts to oxygen or water, or by its ability to burn.

## [Lesson 7.3: Chemical Reactions](lesson-7.3)

Chemical reactions take place all around us every day-in the kitchen, and even in our gardens. In this lesson you will learn that when two or more types of matter interact with each other in a chemical reaction, atoms from each element combine to form a different substance.

## [Lesson 7.4: Solutions](lesson-7.4)

Solutions can consist of any state of matter. When you mix a glass of instant ice tea you are making a solution of water and powdered tea mix. In this lesson you will learn about different types of solutions and their properties.

## Goal Setting

Choose a relatively simple recipe that involves combining several ingredients and also requires cooking on the stove or in the oven. Write each step of the recipe in a table like the one shown at right. Next, predict whether a chemical or physical change takes place, if a chemical reaction occurs, or a solution is forn1ed at each step. You can check more than one. After you read this chapter, come back to this chart and change your answers if necessary.
