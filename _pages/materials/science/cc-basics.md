*Common Core Basics: Building Essential Test Readiness Skills, Science* will help you learn or strengthen the skills and concepts you need when you take any Common Core State Standards-aligned science test. The book's instructional content is based on the National Science Education Standards of the National Academy of Sciences.

In this book, you will focus on important concepts in three broad areas of science-Life Science, Physical Science, and Earth and Space Science.

Before beginning the lessons in this book, take the **Pretest**. This test will help you identify which skill areas you need to concentrate on most. Use the chart at the end of the Pretest to identify the types of questions you have answered incorrectly and to determine which concepts or skills you need to study further. You may decide to concentrate on specific areas of study or to work through the entire book. The latter decision is recommended, as it will help you to build a strong foundation in the core areas in which you will be tested.

*Common Core Basics: Building Essential Test Readiness Skills, Science* is divided into three units.

**Unit 1: Life Science** covers the fundamentals of biology:

  * [Chapter 1: Human Body and Health](chapter-1) teaches you about human body systems and how those systems interact. It also teaches about health and disease.
  * [Chapter 2: Life Functions and Energy Intake](chapter-2) describes flowering plants and the energy-producing processes of cellular respiration and fermentation.
  * [Chapter 3: Ecosystems](chapter-3) explains ecosystem structure, limitations within ecosystems, relationships among living organisms, and the impact of environmental disturbances.
  * [Chapter 4: Foundations of Life](chapter-4) teaches you about plant and animal cells, simple organisms, invertebrates, and vertebrates.
  * [Chapter 5: Heredity](chapter-5) explains the genetic code and teaches you about inherited traits.
  * [Chapter 6: Evolution](chapter-6) explains the process of natural selection and how life changes over time.

**Unit 2: Physical Science** covers the fundamentals of physics and chemistry:

  * [Chapter 7: Energy](chapter-7) describes energy, waves, electricity, sources of energy, and endothermic and exothermic reactions.
  * [Chapter 8: Work, Motion, and Forces](chapter-8) explains Newton's laws of motion, forces, and simple machines.
  * [Chapter 9: Chemical Properties](chapter-9) teaches you about matter, atoms, compounds and molecules, chemical reactions, solutions, organic chemistry, and chemical equations.

**Unit 3: Earth and Space Science** covers the fundamentals of Earth and space sciences:

  * [Chapter 10: Earth and Living Things](chapter-10) describes the cycles of matter and the formation of fossil fuels.
  * [Chapter 11: Earth](chapter-11) provides an overview of geology, oceanography, and meteorology.
  * [Chapter 12: The Cosmos](chapter-12) teaches you about the origins of the universe, the Milky Way, the solar system, and Earth and the Moon.

In addition, *Common Core Basics: Building Essential Test Readiness Skills, Science* also includes a number of special features to guide your progress:

  * The **Chapter Opener** provides an overview of the chapter content and a goal-setting activity.
  * **Lesson Objectives** state what you will be able to accomplish after completing a lesson.
  * **Skills** list the Core Skills and Reading Skills that are applied to lesson content. The Core Skills align to the Common Core State Standards.
  * **Vocabulary** terms essential for understanding are listed on the opening page of a lesson. Bold words in the text are listed in the Glossary.
  * The **Key Concept** summarizes the lesson's content focus.
  * Instruction and practice are provided for **Core Skills** and **Reading Skills** in the context of lessons. Special features, including **21st Century Skills**, help you apply higher-order thinking skills to real-world examples.
  * **Think About Science** questions check your understanding of content throughout a lesson.
  * **Write to Learn** activities give you a purpose for writing.
  * An end-of-lesson **Vocabulary Review** checks your understanding of important lesson vocabulary, whereas **Skill Review** and **Skill Practice** help you assess your learning of content and fundamental skills.
  * The **Chapter Review** tests your understanding of the chapter content.
  * **Check Your Understanding** charts link items to corresponding review pages.
  * The **Answer Key** explains the answers for questions in the book.
  * The **Glossary** and **Index** contain key terms found throughout the book and make it easy to review important skills and concepts.

After you have completed the book, take the **Posttest** to see how well you have learned the concepts and skills the book presents.

Keep in mind that learning the fundamentals of science will help you understand practical aspects of daily life and provide the framework for more advanced studies in science. Good luck with your studies!
