*Common Core Basics: Building Essential Test Readiness Skills, Writing* will help you learn or strengthen the skills you need when you take any Common Core State Standards-aligned writing test. To answer some questions, you will need to focus on sentence structure, grammar, and mechanics. To answer other questions, you will need to concentrate on the organization of sentences within a paragraph. These skills are also important when you are asked to write short or extended response essays.

Before beginning the lessons in this book, take the **Pretest**. This test will help you identify which skill areas you need to concentrate on most. Use the chart at the end of the Pretest to pinpoint the types of questions you have answered incorrectly and to determine which skills you need to work on. You may decide to concentrate on specific areas of study or to work through the entire book. It is highly recommended that you do work through the whole book to build a strong foundation in the core areas in which you will be tested.
