**Colorado contracts with vendors of three high school equivalency examinations**

The Colorado Department of Education signed contracts with vendors of three high school equivalency examinations, providing Colorado residents seeking a high school equivalency exam a range of options never before available.

For nearly 50 years only one high school equivalency exam existed, GED. Now, Colorado will have three options, including GED.

To give students more options to attain a high school equivalency diploma, the Colorado State Board of Education in December 2015 directed CDE staff to enter into contract negotiations with vendors of two other examinations. Recently, Colorado Education Commissioner Rich Crandall signed contracts with all three vendors â€“ **GED**, **HiSET** and **TASC**.

CDE-approved testing centers may choose to administer one or more of the high school equivalency exams at their discretion.
