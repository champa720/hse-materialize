**Congratulations!** If you are using this book, it means that you are taking a key step toward achieving an important new goal for yourself. You are preparing to take your high school equivalency test in order to earn your high school diploma, one of the most important steps in the pathway toward career, educational, and lifelong well-being and success.

*Common Core Achieve: Mastering Essential Test Readiness Skills* is designed to help you learn or strengthen the skills you will need when you take your high school equivalency test. The program includes four core student modules â€“ *Reading & Writing, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies*. Each of these modules provides subject-level pre- and posttests, in-depth instruction and practice of the core skills and practices required for high school equivalency tests, and a number of additional helpful features to help you master all the skills you need for success on test day and beyond.

**How to Use This Book**

Before beginning the lessons in each module, take the **Pretest**. This will give you a preview of the types of questions you will be answering on the high school equivalency test. More important, it will help you identify which skill areas you need to concentrate on most. Use the evaluation chart at the end of the Pretest to pinpoint the types of questions you have answered incorrectly and to determine which skills you need to work on. The evaluation chart will also help you identify where to go within the module for additional instruction and practice. You may decide to concentrate on specific areas of study or to work through the entire module. It is highly recommended that you do work through the whole module to build a strong foundation in the core areas in which you will be tested.

*Common Core Achieve: Mastering Essential Test Readiness Skills* includes a number of features designed to familiarize you with high school equivalency tests and to prepare you for test taking.
