## About TASC Test Mathematics

In the Mathematics test there are number and quantity, algebra, functions, and geometry questions, as well as some that cover statistics and probability. Most are word problems and involve real-life situations or ask examinees to interpret information presented in diagrams, charts, graphs, and tables. Section 1 of the Mathematics test allows examinees to use a calculator. A calculator is not used in Section 2. Examinees will also be given a page of mathematic formulas to use during the test.

## The Mathematics Section

At Data Recognition Corporation &#124; CTB, we have organized the TASC Test Assessing Secondary Completion&trade; according to varying levels of emphasis. High emphasis areas are incredibly important for test takers, as they are the focus of the majority of questions on the exam. In terms of the math section, you should focus particularly on your [mathematical reasoning](http://www.tasctest.com/blog.html#ufh-i-46796860-what-you-need-to-know-about-mathematical-reasoning).

Start studying for your high school equivalency by familiarizing yourself with these high emphasis areas. Once you’ve mastered these areas, you can move onto the medium and low emphases.

### Mathematical Reasoning
 
Mathematical reasoning is a critical skill that enables individuals to recognize and understand many levels of mathematics. You’ll need to be able to understand the following:

  * Basic math
  * Word problems
  * [Algebra](http://www.tasctest.com/blog.html#ufh-i-46796494-solving-simple-equations-tasc-math)
  * [Geometry](http://www.tasctest.com/blog.html#ufh-i-46796368-geometric-measurement-tasc-math)
  
Using these levels, guide yourself through simple skills like addition and subtraction, and develop more advanced skills like [solving polynomial operations](http://www.tasctest.com/blog.html#ufh-i-46796782-polynomials-operations-and-graphs-tasc-math) and [graphing solutions](http://www.tasctest.com/blog.html#ufh-i-46796278-graphing-solutions-to-linear-inequalities-tasc-test-math). Ultimately, you need to be comfortable with equation and applying formulas to mathematical problems at all levels.
