After students complete the sidebar activity on their own, have them form small groups to discuss their findings.

Will what they see affect how they view their own lives in their own homes? What benefits will they gain? What harm might this new technology do? After students have finished their articles, invite them to post the articles for the class to read."

## Before Lesson

Ask students if they can think of an example of the spread of American culture and business around the world. (Sample answers: spread of American music, American television, American fast food restaurants, American computer brands, American clothing) Ask students if they can think of ways that life in the United States has changed because of the nation's involvement with other cultures. (Sample answers: ma11y restaurants serve food from other cultures; products Americans buy are produced in other countries)

## Background

Explain that due to advances in travel and technology, many countries, including the United States, have become more involved in world politics and business. This has advantages for the countries involved, but it also places more responsibility on them. The involvement of the United States in the Middle East is an example of this involvement. Ask students to share ideas about the advantages (such as expansion of US businesses) and responsibilities (such as support for human rights) that have come along with US involvement in other countries. Lead the discussion as necessary if students are unfamiliar with US involvement in countries around the world.

## Guided Practice

  - The US Role
    - Foreign Aid
    - Trade Agreements
    - The Spread of US Culture
  - US Businesses Expand Globally
  - Fair Trade
  - US Nonprofit and Humanitarian Organizations

## Core Skill

**Interpret Graphics:** Have students look at the photos used in the beginning of the lesson for a refresher on interpreting photos. Remind students to use cause-and-effect language in their sentences. Have students create a presentation slide combining their image and their sentence. Then combine the slides into a class slideshow.

**Make Predictions:** Remind students that making predictions involves drawing on their knowledge and guessing what they think will happen. You may wish to have students work in pairs or small groups to complete this exercise. Then have each pair or group share their ideas with the class.

## Extension

**Review the Lesson:** After students have read the lesson, list the major headings and have students tell you in one sentence what each sect10n was about. This will help them recall material and help you assess their comprehension.

**Cause and Effect:** Divide students into small groups. Have each group develop an idea for how a nonprofit organization can address an issue they are passionate about. Ask students to investigate their group's cause on the Internet, draw evidence from reliable websites, and use cause-and-effect organization to formulate a plan showing how the proposed actions of their nonprofit group would impact the targeted problems. Ask students to create a poster about the organization that summarizes the cause-and-effect aspects of their plan and cites supporting evidence. Have the groups use their posters to present their organizations to the class. Finish the activity by having the class vote on which organization to support.
