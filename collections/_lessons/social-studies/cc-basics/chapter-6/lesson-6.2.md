  title: Evidence-Based Reading
  content: "**Visualize:** Explain to students that visualizing what they read helps comprehension. Ask students to form pictures in their minds as they read and take notes on what they see. For instance, if they read about the Mississippi River, they might imagine a wide body of water; if they read about giant companies, they might picture a huge skyscraper with a large company logo at the top. Then have students discuss their visualization in small groups."

  title: 21st Century Skill
  content: "**Understand Current Events:** Ask students to image that they are residents of the territory they chose. How would they feel about being controlled by the United States? Have volunteers give a brief presentation as a resident explaining why their territory should or should not be under US control."

  title: Writing Practice
  content: "Before students begin, have them think about ways in which a blog differs from a report. They may point out that a blog is a personal response to a situation, so it may include different information and have a different tone. Also, its purpose may be different from that of a report. Sample answers may describe a different language spoken by the new government's leaders and that language being imposed upon the media, schools, and the public. Perhaps different foods are appearing in the markets while familiar foods are disappearing. Different modes of dress may be favored by people within the new government."

## Before Lesson

Have students identify ways that new technologies, such as smartphones and the Internet, have changed how we live. Tell them that after the Civil War, new technology enabled industry to grow quickly in cities throughout the United States. Ask them to suggest how this rapid industrialization might have changed US society. Write students' responses on the board for discussion. (Sample answers: People moved to the cities to work in factories. More settlers moved to live in the new states out west because of more efficient modes of transportation.)

## Background

Explain the concepts of industrialization and imperialism to students. With them, create a K-W-L chart on the board. Elicit what they already know to fill in the K column, and work with them to develop questions for the W (want to know) column. Then have them copy the chart into their notebooks and fill in the L (learn) column as they read the lesson.

## Guided Practice

- Changes in Society
- Workers and Farmers Respond
- Imperialism
  - Spanish-American War
  - Hawaiian Islands, Latin America, China, and the Caribbean

## Core Skill

**Analyze Events and Ideas:** Call students' attention to the elements in the cartoon that reflect Rockefeller's values. What do they think the cartoonist's values are? Do they think the cartoonist's values differ from those of Rockefeller? (Sample answers: Rockefeller seems to think he is king of the world, sitting on a throne built of money and his oil monopoly. The cartoonist seems to think this is an unjust situation; his values seem to be quite different from Rockefeller's.) Invite volunteers to share the sentences they wrote in their notebooks.

**Understand the Main Idea:** Have students work with a partner to find the main idea of the paragraph. Tell them first to identify the topic of the paragraph and then to determine the main point the writer wants to make about that topic. Have one partner share their findings with the class.

## Extension

**Word Families:** Have students look at the boldfaced words on pages 250-253. Point out the words industrialization, urbanization, and mechanization. Ask students to list all the forms they can think of for each word (for example, industry, industrial, industrialize, industrialization or urban, urbanize, urbanization). Discuss what part of speech each word is and how the two noun forms, if there are two, differ in meaning. Have students work in pairs to come up with similar groups of words.

**Develop a Logical Argument:** Hold a student debate. Write two or three proposals on the board, such as The US should annex Mexico or The US should annex Canada.'' Then divide students into an even number of groups. Assign each group a proposal to investigate and a position to take (for or against). Have the groups investigate historic and economic aspects of their topic to formulate arguments and cite evidence in support of their position. Each group should create a formal opening statement, develop a logical series of arguments, reserve material for use in rebuttal, and summarize their arguments in a one-minute closing statement. Poll the audience before and after the debate to see whether their minds have been changed by the teams' arguments.
