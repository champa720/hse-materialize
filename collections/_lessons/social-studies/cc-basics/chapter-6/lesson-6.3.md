excerpt: "Economic cycles are often fueled by advances in science. For instance, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, discoveries and ideas in astronomy, chemistry, physics, and other fields provided new knowledge about our world. People used this knowledge to invent new machines and processes. This progress drove the Industrial Revolution and the Transportation Revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Scientific discoveries have continued to affect the economy. A good example is today's Digital Revolution."

  content: "**Understand Author's Purpose:** Review *A Revolution in Your Hand* on page 256. Tell students that the author has tried to make the writing understandable by writing an interesting header, boldfacing important words, and referring to familiar events, like watching TV and using a smartphone. As you progress, invite students to point out similar features in other parts of the lesson and explain how these features help them understand the text."

  title: Workplace Connection
  content: "**Compare Tasks:** Tell students to think about how they write a research report. Ask them what sources they use, how they find them, and how they write the reports-by hand, on a computer, or using another device? Then have students offer suggestions for how they think people wrote reports a hundred years ago. Point out that they would have had to use only print books and write on paper by hand or on an early manual typewriter. Explain that these major differences exist in many areas of life, especially in the modem workplace."

  title: Writing Practice
  content: "Tell students that they should spend a few minutes thinking about the assignment before they begin. To complete the activity, students need to select a device and to fully understand the four revolutions mentioned in the lesson. If students find any of these things missing from their inventory, they need to obtain the information before they begin the assignment."

## Before Lesson

Ask students if they know what a revolution is. If they are not sure, offer some ideas (a drastic change in government, a sudden shift to a new way of doing things). Write the word revolution on the board and guide the class into defining it as a sudden and dramatic change. Challenge students to name revolutions in various areas of life, such as in music (the introduction of rock and roll), in history (the American Revolution), and in clothing (the creation of synthetic fabric). If students can grasp the concept of these revolutions, they will be prepared to grasp the revolutions discussed in this lesson.

## Background

Invite students to talk about how life in their community or region might have changed over the last SO, 100, and 200 years. For each change, have students infer whether it was a result of scientific discoveries, a shift to factory work, a change in transportation, or a change related to digital products like computers or other devices. Tell students that they will learn more about revolutions that happened as a result of these types of changes.

## Guided Practice

- A Revolution in Your Hand
- The Scientific Revolution
- The Industrial Revolution
- The Transportation Revolution
- The Digital Revolution

## Core Skill

**Sequence Events:** Talk to students about proportionality and scale on time lines. Explain that a good time line will have a consistent amount of space allotted to each length of time. For example, if an inch on the time line represents ten years on the left side of the time line, it should represent ten years everywhere on the time line. Make sure students' time lines are constructed accordingly.

**Analyze Events and Ideas:** Point out to students that the questions in the activity are focusing on causes and effects. A cause is what makes something happen; an effect is what happens because of a cause. Point out that effects often become causes themselves, leading to new effects. Challenge students to point out how mills were built is both the effect of one thing (the need for water to power machinery) and the cause of another effect (the growth of towns).

## Extension

**Recall and List Key Events:** Direct students to recall and list the four revolutions explained in the lesson-Scientific, Industrial, Transportation, and Digital. Pair students with fluent English speakers and have them verbally state why each revolution was important.

**Hypothesize about the Future:** No one knows for certain what the future holds, but have students hypothesize about it. Do students expect things to gradually change, or might there be another revolution? What might that revolution be? Encourage class participation and tell students to focus on developing logical arguments to support what they forecast.
