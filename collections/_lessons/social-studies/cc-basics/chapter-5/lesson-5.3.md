## Before Lesson

Ask students to recall any recent news items they have read or heard about the government's role in the economy. (Sample answers: changes in the base interest rate, social security, or unemployment benefits; debates about tax law) Ask: What do you think about the role of the government regarding these news items?

## Background

Work with students to recall what they have learned about the US economy. Ask them why they think the role of government in the US economy has expanded in the past century. If they struggle, mention Roosevelt's policies in response to the Great Depression and Johnson's Great Society programs. Have students create a time line tracing this expansion as they read Government's Role in the Economy.

## Core Skill

**Evaluate Reasoning (page 198):** Provide students with an example of faulty logic from an advertisement or magazine. Work with students to identify the faulty logic and why it is not sound reasoning. When they complete the sidebar activity, invite students to share their examples and analyses with the class.

**Evaluate Reasoning (page 199):** Have students create a clean final draft of their paragraph. Use these to compile a student pamphlet on public goods.

**Analyze Information:** Provide small groups of students with editorials on economics. Have them underline facts, circle the main idea, and decide whether the author has convinced them based on the facts.

## Extension

**Proofread:** Remind students to proofread their written work to find errors in capitalization, punctuation, grammar, spelling, and word choice. Tell them that it can be difficult to proofread your own work, especially in a language you are learning. One good strategy is to wait until the next day to do the proofreading. Another is to read the text aloud and listen to what you have written. Have them ask themselves: Does it sound like the English you hear around you? If not, they should check for errors.

**Formulate a Plan:** Have students write an editorial formulating a plan related to taxes proposing it, and developing a logical argument to support their proposal. They may feel that a particular tax, such as property tax, is unfair or unreasonable. They may argue that certain taxes should be raised in order to fund a new government program or expand an existing one.
