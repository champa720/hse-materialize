## Before Lesson

Ask students to recall news items they have heard or read that were about financial institutions. (They might mention changes in mortgage interest rates, controversies about bonuses for upper management, issues relating to home foreclosures, problems with credit card debt, etc.)

## Background

Guided Ask students to identify different types of financial institutions in the United States (banks, credit unions). Invite volunteers to share what they know about such institutions. Use their comments to create a list of institutions and a brief description of each. Tell students that financial institutions have two basic functions: providing means of saving/investing and providing loans. Help students recognize the relationship between the two functions.

## Guided Practice

- Money and Its Uses
  - Functions of Money
  - Types of Money
- The Money Supply
- Financial Institutions
  - Commercial Banks
  - Savings Institutions
  - Credit Unions
- Government Oversight of Financial Institutions
  - Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
  - The Federal Reserve System
  - Other Agencies

## Core Skill

**Evaluate Evidence:** Have students complete this activity in pairs or small groups and then poll the class to compare answers. Resolve any differences as a class by evaluating the evidence in the passage.

**Distinguish Fact from Opinion:** Group students who wrote about the same institutions and have them compare and contrast the facts and opinions they found. Invite them to share interesting discoveries with the class.

## Extension

**Summarize a Paragraph:** Read to students the second paragraph under the heading The Federal Reserve System on page 205. Then go over the material again, using simpler language. Explain, for instance, what the word panic means in this context. Have students write a sentence summarizing the paragraph.

**Distinguish Different Measurements:** Have students investigate other ways that economists measure the US money supply and differentiate between them. For example, M2 and M3 include savings accounts, stocks, bonds, and retirement accounts. Challenge students to determine why these types of money are not included in the Ml money supply. Have them write a paragraph supporting their interpretation.
