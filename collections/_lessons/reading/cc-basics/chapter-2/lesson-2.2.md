## Before Lesson

Students have learned that informative texts give facts and details or explain how to do something. Ask students for examples of informative text that they encounter on a regular basis. Make a list on the board. Sample responses: newspaper article, online article, magazine article, instructions, textbook chapter, e-mail, handbook section. With students, write an informative sentence about the class on the board. Sample: This class meets three times a week and discusses reading. E.>. -p. lain that students will learn more about reading informative texts in this lesson.

## Background

Tell students that there are many reasons for reading. To learn and understand new or current information, you might read newspaper and magazine articles. Show students a variety of newspaper and magazine articles and discuss the purpose of each one. Ask students to describe recent magazine or newspaper articles they have read and the kind of information they got from them.

## Guided Practice

- Magazine and Newspaper Articles

## Core Skill

**Analyze Text Structure:** Tell students that looking at headings is one key to understanding an article or finding the information you want. Display an online or print article to the class. Go over the headings and have students tell what the article is generally about. Ask them which section they would read to find out a certain piece of information. Then read the article on page 96 with students. Have them point out the headings, picture, and caption. After they list the headings and write in their notebooks, have them share their notes with partners and refine them as necessary.

**Evaluate Content in Different Formats:** Discuss with students the different formats described in the text (circle graph, bar graph, line graph) and show an example of each one. Explain to students that charts and tables can also be used to compare information. Read the table on page 97 with students. Explain that they can use the heading and the information in the table to determine the main idea. After students write the main idea in their notebooks, discuss it as a class by emphasizing the title and the column and row headings.

## Extension

**Describe Graphs:** Show students a bar graph, a circle graph, and a line graph. Point to each and have students discuss what the graph might be about. Point to the legend and explain how it works. Have students find another graph and explain it to a partner.

**Graph Data:** Remind students that a graph shows how two or more things relate. Review the Core Skill sidebar on page 97 with students. Have students create a line graph to show the changes in the temperature for the past week in your town.

## Lesson Review

**Write to Learn:** Remind students that summarizing means retelling the main points in their own words. Have them jot down notes as they reread the article and use those notes to write their summaries. Then have students read their summaries to a partner. Listeners should check to make sure the speaker.
