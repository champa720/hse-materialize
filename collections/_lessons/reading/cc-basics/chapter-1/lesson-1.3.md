## Before Lesson

Most students will probably be familiar with websites. For those who are not, explain that websites are collections of pages on the Internet (a way to search and communicate via computer) that give information. Ask: Which websites do you use most frequently? Why do you use those instead of others? What kind of information do you find on those websites?

## Background

Tell students that websites are a great source of information on many topics. Explain that to become effective web users, students must know how to navigate the web and how to check for reliability and accuracy. Have volunteers look up one or two of the websites students mentioned using frequently. Ask students if the websites appear reliable and accurate and why. (Possible answers: .edu, .org, and .gov sites are reliable and accurate.) Explain that students will learn more about using websites in this lesson.

## Guided Practice

- Websites
- Reliability of Information

## Core Skill

**Analyze Visual Information:** Look at the website with students. Have them point to the different features as you name them. After students write in their notebooks, have them look up a museum website and list the features on the site and what content is represented by these features.

**Synthesis Ideas from Multiple Sources:** Explain that doing research usually involves taking ideas from many different sources and using them as support for your own idea. Have students brainstorm a list of questions about the website on page 33 and write their questions on the board. Work with students to go online and find the answers to the questions. Show students how to use key words from their questions to help them find the answers.

## Extension

**Elaborate on Language:** Discuss additional words associated with websites and the Internet that students might not be familiar with. Use the websites in this lesson to point to and then explain these words: toolbar, icon, URL, menu bars, links, search feature.

**Distinguish Key Words:** Ask students to think of a topic they would like to investigate on the Internet. Then have them each write a list of possible search words that they think will lead them to information about the topic. Have students do the searches and refine their search words. Have them continue to do this until they find three or four reliable sites.
