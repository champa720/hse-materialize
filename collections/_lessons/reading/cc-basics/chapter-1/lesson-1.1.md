## Before Lesson

Tell students that informational text provides readers with information, such as facts about a subject or a description of something. Ask small groups of students to open a classroom book and try to find examples of informational text. Once they locate informational text, have a volunteer from each group read a paragraph aloud for the class and state what information it provides.

## Background

Tell students that to be smart consumers and capable employees, they need to be able to read and understand different types of practical documents. They need to understand memos and forms, which are two common business documents. Provide students with a sample memo and ask students questions to lead to understanding: Is there a title? What does the memo say? What is it asking the employee to do? Why do you think the manager wrote it? Does the memo include a date or deadline? Also ask students if they have ever filled out a form, such as a change of address form, or if they have sent or received a memo at work.

## Guided Practice

- Informational Text

## Core Skill

**Draw Conclusions:** Explain that informational text provides important facts and details. Tell students that a work memo can contain information about meetings, schedules, policies, or other work-related topics. Point out the parts of the memo on page 14. Ask students to tell who wrote the memo, whom it is for, and what the memo is about.

**Utilize Forms:** Reread the memo on page 14 with students. Have them answer the questions about the memo and read aloud the sentences that helped them draw conclusions about the answers.

## Extension

**Practice Accuracy:** For accuracy, have students practice difficult words from the memo on page 14 separately from the context of the passage.

**Assess Memos:** Have students construct their own business memo to a classmate. Encourage them to develop a topic using formal language. Have students exchange memos with a classmate and assess the memo for clarity and purpose.
