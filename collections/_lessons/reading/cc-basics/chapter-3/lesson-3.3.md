## Before Lesson

Ask students if they have ever read blogs, or online writings that express the Writer's opinions. If so, ask: Which blogs do you read? What kind of subject matter do the blogs deal with ? Write students' responses on the board and use them to show that blogs can be about almost anything, from politics to sports to baby clothes or even writing itself.

## Background

Explain to students that blogs are basically online conversations between ordinary people. Some blogs contain information on a particular topic, such as cooking or surfing. Others are like journals, where people document the events of their daily lives. Ask students to describe a blog topic that would interest them.

## Guided Practice

- Blogs

## Core Skill

**Draw Evidence from Text:** Explain that many blog writers use emotional words to appeal to or persuade their readers. Read aloud one of the blogs from earlier in the lesson. As you read, have students raise their hands when they hear an emotional word. Write these words on the board. As students complete the activity on page 134, circulate to ensure that they correctly understand positive and negative connotations.

**Determine Author’s Purpose:** Tell students that bias is a prejudice for or against someone or something. Explain that many blog writers show their bias by using words with positive or negative connotations to sway their readers. Using one of the blogs students have already encountered, work with students to locate bias by marking words with positive or negative connotations and drawing a conclusion.

## Extension

**Echo Read:** Give students a copy of one of the blogs from the lesson. Read it aloud with proper phrasing and expression. Then have students read the blog aloud and ask them to imitate the way you read. Then have pairs practice reading aloud until they can do so fluently.

**Critique a Blog:** Have pairs of students work together to decide on a blog topic and write the text for a short blog. Have them trade blogs with another pair and critique that blog based on bias, strength of argument, and persuasiveness.

## Lesson Review

**Write to Learn:** Remind students to structure their writing with a beginning, a middle, and an end.

- Beginning: Introduce the topic, get readers' attention, and state your judgment.
- Middle: Support your position and give reasons.
- End: Sum up your reasons.
