## Before Lesson

Ask students what an opinion is (how someone feels about something). Explain that an opinion is not necessarily based on facts, and a reader may agree or disagree with the writer's opinion. State an opinion aloud, such as: Red is the best color for a car. Have students raise their hands if they agree with this opinion. Then have students state opinions on other topics, such as books, restaurants, or movies.

## Background

Ask students if they form opinions about the movies or TV shows they watch. Explain that reviews and commentaries can give information and help them focus on the things that interest them. Tell students to keep in mind that a review gives the writer's opinion. Read aloud a movie review and ask students to restate the reviewer's opinion about the movie.

## Guided Practice

- Reviews

## Core Skill

**Interpret Words and Phrases in Text:** Explain that context clues help a reader understand how an author feels about something. Provide a restaurant review to students and ask them to identify the author's opinion. Ask: Which words clued you in to the author's opinion? Then reread the excerpt on page 142 with students. Have them answer the questions in the sidebar and tell which details they underlined.

**Infer:** Explain that students will practice making inferences. Read the review aloud with students. After each paragraph, have students share which words or information can help them make an inference. Write their responses on the board. After students have read the entire review, have them use the notes on the board to make an inference.

## Extension

**Identify Cognates:** Review vocabulary words with English language learners by pointing out those that have Spanish cognates: analysis/andlisis, commentary/ comentario, criticize/criticar, implied! implicito, inference/inferencia, interpretlinterpretar

**Assess a Review:** Have students bring in a review about a movie, TV program, or product. Tell them to identify the introduction, the summary, the analysis, and the conclusion. Have students analyze the review for a positive or a negative tone and assess the strength of the review.

## Lesson Review

**Write to Learn:** Remind students of what they just read in the box on page 142. Read the question (How do these words persuade the reader?) and work with students to make a list on the board of the words and phrases this author used that the class has encountered in other reviews.
