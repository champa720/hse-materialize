## Before Lesson

In this lesson, students multiply and divide positive and negative whole numbers. To demonstrate readiness, have students review multiplying and dividing whole numbers by finding 1-digit by 1-digit products and the corresponding quotients.

## Background

Remind students that multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition. Demonstrate -2Ã—4=(-2)+(-2)+(-2)+(-2) on a number line. Ask: What is the sign of the sum? What will be the sign of the product? Have students predict the sign in the division of negative integers.

## Guided Practice

- Multiply Integers
- Read a Table
- Divide integers

## Core Skill

**Interpret Data Displays:** Give students time to read the text in the sidebar. Then, together, discuss the features of the table. Ask the question that follows, and invite volunteers to answer. Students may say, for example, that it would be helpful to expand the table to include more months, or they may even want to insert more columns to show how many adult men and women also visit the park in the same months.

**Use Appropriate Tools Strategically:** Allow students time to read the sidebar and answer the questions that follow. Explain that a table is a way to show information, and just like word problems, it is important to understand the given information first before solving problems based on the table.

## Extension

**Make a Table:** Ask students to think about how many minutes they spend watching television or online during the school week and on the weekends. Record and average their answers as they observe. Then ask students to explain how you can organize the data you have collected in a table to make it easier to read and understand. Direct students to tell you exactly what to do, one step at a time. Respond to their commands, making changes as students become aware of their necessity. Discuss the features of the final table.

**Compare Operations:** Have students work in small groups to create Venn diagrams. Provide them with copies of an empty diagram (see the Graphic Organizer section of the Instructor Resource Binder). Have students label one circle: Adding and Subtracting Integers. Have them label the second circle: Multiplying and Dividing Integers. Have them use the Math Links and text in the chapter to fill in as many details as possible in the diagram.
