GED SKILL Analyzing Character

Fiction writers create people, or characters, to capture a reader's interest. There are several ways to find out about characters in literature. Writers develop characters by describing what the characters look like, how they behave, what they think and say, and what their characters say about them.

Read the following excerpt from a novel and complete the exercise below.

Mr. Chadband is a large yellow man, with a fat smile and a general appearance of having a good deal of train-oil in his system. Mr. Chadband moves softly and cumbrously, not unlike a bear who has been taught to walk upright. He is very much embarrassed about the arms, as if they were inconvenient to him, and he wanted to grovel; is very much in a perspiration about the head; and never speaks without first putting up his great hand, as delivering a token to his hearers that he is going to edify them.

"My friends;" says Mr. Chadband, "peace be on this house! On the master thereof, on the mistress thereof, on the young maidens, and on the young men! My friends, why do I wish for peace? What is peace? Is it war? No. Is it strife? No. Is it lovely, and gentle, and beautiful, and pleasant, and serene, and joyful? Oh yes! Therefore, my friends, I wish. for peace upon you and upon yours."

1. Put a check mark by all of the following that are true of Mr. Chadband.
    1. He is a man of few words.

2. Underline descriptive phrases in the excerpt that tell you something about Mr. Chadband's character.
