I ain't been scared' o' nothin', but I'll tell ya' I was scared then. See, I'm big, and most guys won't mess with me, but this was different. It wasn't anything you could fight.

I drove my car over to the school... s'posed to be a first meetin'. I sat in my car and gripped the steerin' wheel. I thought of all.the other things I could be doin'... stayin' home to watch TV, or stoppin' at Amie's... the guys are usually hangin' around most nights.

I got out of the car. I walked toward the building : It was all lit up like a shopping center havin' a sale. Other people were walkin' in, too. I looked at them. Some of 'em were dressed  pretty good... probably smart too... smarter than me. I knew they're probably smarter 'n me 'cuz I always felt so dumb in school. That's why I dropped out... I got behind 'cuz my folks moved a lot an' I never could catch up; so I quit to get a job so I could get a car. When you're young, you think like that... think the only thing in the world is a job and a car so you can impress the girls.

Anyhow, as I say, I stood there watchin' and feelin' stupid. Finally I turned on my heel and went back to the car. I got in and sat there with the keys in the ignition and my right hand about to turn 'em when I thought of Peg and the kids. They were dependin' on me Now that I got them, I gotta get a better job, and I can't with the education I got. I'm 'last  hired and first fired' as they say.

So I got back outta the car and fought my gut that was in a knot and found the room and walked in.

That's how I got here , and I'm sure glad I did. I'm gonna get my diploma at night school.. I know it. And I also found out we're all in the same boat. I ain't the only one who needs to learn the stuff I missed out on before. We're all the same-ain't nobody here any different.
