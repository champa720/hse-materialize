Even as I hold you \\
I think of you as_someone gone \\
far, far away. Your eyes the color \\
of pennies in a bowl of dark honey \\
bringing sweet light to someone else \\
your black hair gripping through my fingers \\
is the flash of your head going \\
around a corner \\
your smile, breaking before me, \\
the flippant last turn \\
of a revolving door, \\
emptying you out, changed, \\
away from me.

Even as I hold you \\
I am letting you go.
