I was the last passenger of the day, \\
I was alone on the bus, \\
I was glad they were spending all that money \\
just getting me up Eighth Avenue. \\
Driver! I shouted, it’s you and me tonight, \\
let’s run away from this big city \\
to a smaller city more suitable to the heart, \\
let’s drive past the swimming pools of Miami Beach, \\
you in the driver’s seat, me several seats back, \\
but in the racial cities we’ll change places \\
so as to show how well you’ve done up North, \\
and let us find ourselves some tiny American fishing village \\
in unknown Florida \\
and park right at the edge of the sand, \\
a huge bus pointing out, \\
metallic, painted, solitary, \\
with New York plates.
