SEPTEMBER \\
Rain sweeps across the roof \\
Clearing nostrils cleaning minds \\
Purging asphalt in the urban forest \\
primeval \\
We creatures who live under rocks \\
Are surprised come morning

OCTOBER \\
Twilight mist smokes sad cigars \\
Culls candy sweetness \\
Passion \\
Paused for proffered gems \\
Captures facets \\
Pasting diamonds in the sky

NOVEMBER \\
Here am I \\
Present and accountable \\
I am rain standing \\
Wind walking \\
Fire sitting \\
Join my breathing \\
Here am I \\
I am here \\
I do

DECEMBER \\
Standing mute in timberland \\
The grand fall-timbred lute thrums forth \\
the hum \\
Lending credence to the season \\
Swirling spackled clouds dip low \\
As winter looms \\
And spirits \\
Sink \\
cold
