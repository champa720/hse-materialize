The Science subtest measures your ability to use science content knowledge, apply principles of scientific inquiry, and interpret and evaluate scientific information. Most of the questions provide descriptions of scientific investigations and their results. Scientific information is based on reports that might be found in scientific journals. Graphs, tables and charts are used to present information and results.

The questions use material from a variety of content areas such as: physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, health and astronomy. You may be asked to identify the research question of interest, select the best design for a specific research question and recognize conclusions that can be drawn from results.
